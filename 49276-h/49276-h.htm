<h4>I. THE NEW ENGLAND STATES</h4>

<p>During the colonial era the broad outlines and essential
principles of the American divorce law, as it still exists in
the various states, had already taken form. Long before the
Revolution it was predetermined that a free and tolerant
policy in this regard must prevail in the United States. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
task of the legislator during the century following the birth
of the nation has, in general, consisted in effecting a further
liberalization in the causes of divorce; while at the same
time the details of the system have been gradually wrought
out. At the close of the period one finds much more elaborate
and careful provisions regarding causes, residence, notice,
alimony and property than at the beginning. An
attempt will be made in this chapter to sketch the course of
legislation in all of the states during a hundred and twenty-five
years. Necessarily only the more salient features can
be brought out. The beginning and the end, with some of
the more important intervening changes, may be dwelt upon.
The immense volume of laws, the constant stream of legislative
enactments, the ceaseless tinkering of the statute-maker,
the wearisome repetitions, render anything more than
this very difficult and perhaps unnecessary. The most that
one can hope for is to make the right impression; to disclose
the true perspective by a judicious selection and grouping
of the materials.</p>

<p><i>a</i>) <i>Jurisdiction; causes and kinds of divorce.</i>&mdash;Through
their silence on the subject nearly all of the first state
constitutions left the power of granting divorces in the
hands of the legislative bodies. In Massachusetts, however,
the practice of the provincial period was temporarily continued.
"All causes of marriage, divorce, and alimony,"
declares the constitution of 1780, "shall be heard by the
Governor and Council, until the Legislature shall by law
make other provision."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Such provision was made in 1786.
Yet six years thereafter Governor Hancock is obliged to return
to the senate unsigned a bill "for dissolving the bond of
matrimony between Daniel Chickering and Abigail his wife,"
remarking that it is unconstitutional and the proposed divorce
is for a cause for which by law only a separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
may be granted.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> By the act of 1786 all questions of
divorce and alimony are referred to the "Supreme Judicial
Court holden for the County where the parties live," and its
decrees are final.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Here the jurisdiction remained until
1887, when it was vested in the superior court with appeal
to the first-named tribunal; and the power to hear petitions
for separate maintenance and for the care, custody, education,
and support of minor children was given to the courts
of probate in the several counties.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The statute of 1786 is reactionary with respect to the
grounds of divorce. It is expressly declared that no divorce
from the bond of matrimony, in the proper sense of the
word, shall be allowed except for impotency or adultery in
either of the parties. But in the outset it is necessary to be
on one's guard against a confusion of terms caused by a retention
of canonical usage. In this act, and for many years in
the statutes of Massachusetts, as in those of some of the
other states, the sentence of nullity of void or voidable wedlock,
on the usual grounds of forbidden degrees, bigamy, or
the like, is called "divorce."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> For the first time in the revision
of 1835 such unions, if solemnized within the state,
are declared to be "absolutely void, without any decree of
divorce, or other legal process;"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and this is typical of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
tendency in other states<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to adopt what is now the prevailing
usage.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The act under discussion was conservative in another
important respect. Divorce from bed and board, which had
crept into the judicial practice toward the close of the provincial
era, was now allowed either partner by statute on
the one ground of "extreme cruelty." Two new causes were
added twenty-five years later. By the act of 1786, it will be
observed, desertion and long absence, admitted during the
earlier period as sufficient causes for dissolving the marriage
bond, are not mentioned for either kind of divorce.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But in
1811 it was enacted that the wife may be divorced <i>a mensa
et thoro</i>, whenever the husband "shall utterly desert" her,
or whenever, "being of sufficient ability thereto," he shall
"wantonly and cruelly neglect or refuse to provide suitable
maintenance for her."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In all cases of separation from bed
and board, as provided in 1829, the court may assign the
wife all the personal estate which the husband received
through the marriage, or such part of it as may seem just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
under the circumstances; while "all promissory notes and
other choses in action" belonging to her before the marriage,
or made payable during the coverture to her alone, or jointly
with the husband on account of property belonging to her
or debts due to her before the marriage, and all legacies to
her, and personal property, which may have descended to
her, as heir, or be held for her in trust, or in any other way
appertaining to her in her own right, none of which things
enumerated have been reduced to possession by the husband
before the libel was filed, shall be and remain her separate
property; and she is empowered to bring suit to recover it
"in the same manner as if she were a <i>feme sole</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> No
further important change<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the law appears to have been
made before 1870, when divorce from bed and board was
abolished.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Chief interest, therefore, centers in the history of divorce
from the bond of wedlock. To the two grounds of dissolution
originally permitted new causes were added from time
to time. Thus in 1835 the confinement of either spouse at
hard labor under penal sentence for a period of seven years
or more is declared sufficient for such a divorce; and a pardon
granted to the guilty person will not work a restoration of
conjugal rights.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Utter and wilful desertion for a term of
five years came next in 1838;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and in 1850 a fifth cause,
probably relating to the Shakers, was added. If either
partner, it is declared, shall leave the other without consent
and join a "religious sect or society that believes, or professes
to believe, the relation between husband and wife void<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or unlawful," and there remain for three years, such act shall
be deemed in behalf of the injured person a "sufficient cause
of divorce from the bond of matrimony."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>A measure of fundamental importance makes its appearance
in 1867. By it the divorce system of Massachusetts is
completely reorganized. Not only is the way opened for
presently doing away with separation from bed and board,
but provision is made for suspending final action in any suit
for dissolution of marriage by a device similar to that adopted
in the English statute of 1860. The distinction between the
"decree <i>nisi</i>" and the "decree absolute" was then introduced.
"Decrees for divorce from the bond of matrimony
may in the first instance be decrees <i>nisi</i>, to become absolute
after the expiration of such time, not being less than six
months from the entry thereof, as the court shall, by general
or special orders, direct. At the expiration of the time
assigned, on motion of the party in whose favor the decree
was rendered, which motion may be entertained by any judge
in term or vacation, the decree shall be made absolute, if the
party moving shall have complied with the orders of the
court, and no sufficient cause to the contrary shall appear."
The orders of the court referred to require the person in
whose favor a decree <i>nisi</i> has been rendered to publish at
his own cost, in one or more newspapers, designated by the
court, the fact of granting of the decree together with its
terms and such other notice as the court may direct.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It
will be observed that there is no express provision for "intervention,"
as in England by a private citizen or the Queen's
proctor.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The institution of the decree <i>nisi</i> gave the legislator
thereafter a great deal of trouble. Statute after statute
was enacted to alter, extend, or repeal its provisions. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it would be useless to dwell upon, even if the import of some
of them could readily be understood.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> After thirty years of
tinkering and experiment, the law now stands in substance
about as it was first made. By the act of May 2, 1893, all
decrees of divorce are in the first instance to be decrees <i>nisi</i>,
without further proceedings "to become absolute after the
expiration of six months;" unless the court on the application
of some interested person otherwise orders.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
requirement of publication in the newspapers at the expense
of the petitioner is not retained.</p>

<p>The introduction of the decree <i>nisi</i> in 1867, and the abrogation
of the decree from bed and board in 1870, led at once
to an extension of the causes of divorce from the bond of
marriage. In addition to the five grounds already existing,
a statute of the last-named year authorizes a full divorce for
"extreme cruelty," "gross and confirmed habits of intoxication
contracted after marriage," or "cruel or abusive treatment
by either of the parties," and "on the libel of the wife,
when the husband, being of sufficient ability, grossly or
wantonly and cruelly refuses or neglects to provide suitable
maintenance for her." Several of these causes, it will be
noticed, had already existed as grounds for separation from
bed and board, and were now merely transferred to full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
divorce. "Utter desertion," first allowed in 1838, likewise
appears in this act as a new cause; but it is so only for the
reason that all limitation as to the term of desertion is now
omitted.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But in 1873 the period was fixed at three years,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and this term is retained in the present law.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Finally in
1889 dissolution of wedlock is granted for "gross and confirmed
drunkenness" caused "by the voluntary and excessive
use of opium or other drugs."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> By the omission of one, the
modification and combination of others, these ten causes have
now been reduced to seven. By the present law a full
divorce, to be a decree <i>nisi</i> in the first instance, may be
granted for (1) adultery; (2) impotency; (3) utter desertion
for three years; (4) gross and confirmed habits of intoxication
caused by the voluntary and excessive use of intoxicating
liquors, opium, or other drugs; (5) cruel and abusive treatment;
(6) on the libel of the wife, if the husband, being of
sufficient ability, grossly or wantonly and cruelly refuses or
neglects to provide suitable maintenance for her; (7) when
either spouse has been sentenced to confinement at hard
labor for life or for five years or more.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The century's legislation in the other New England states
regarding the causes of divorce shows important differences
in details and in the rate of progress; but the general tendency
and the final result are much the same. For a short
period previous to 1784 the legislature of New Hampshire
exercised the right of granting divorces from the marriage
bond.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The constitution of that year, following the example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of Massachusetts, put a stop to the practice.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> So by the act
of February 17, 1791, which determined the general character
of the divorce laws of that state for half a century,
jurisdiction is vested in the superior court of judicature,
where, under sanction of the constitution<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of 1792, it
remained until 1855, when it was transferred to the supreme
court.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In the outset the laws of New Hampshire are more
liberal in this regard than those of Massachusetts, and the
development is more rapid. By the act of 1791, just mentioned,
a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> may be granted for the impotency,
adultery, extreme cruelty, or three years' absence of
either spouse; and to the wife when the husband wilfully
abandons her for three years, refusing to provide.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But, it
should be observed, separation from bed and board is not
recognized. This law stood unaltered until 1839, when,
in addition to the causes already assigned, a divorce is
authorized for three years' wilful desertion or refusal to
cohabit by either person, if the cause continues at the time
of petition.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The next year a broad step in advance was taken. In
addition to the existing causes, five<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> new and important
grounds were at once introduced. A divorce may be granted
in favor of the "innocent party" when the other is convicted
and actually imprisoned for a felony; or becomes a habitual
drunkard and so continues for three years; or "so treats the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
other, as seriously to injure health, or endanger reason;" or
"when the conduct of either party shall be so gross, wicked
and repugnant to the marriage covenant, as to occasion the
separation of the other for the space of three years."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This
last clause is omitted from the revised statutes of 1842.
But among the twelve grounds there enumerated two new
ones appear. As by the Massachusetts law of 1850, divorce
is now granted either person when the other joins and
remains three years with a religious sect or society "professing
to believe the relation of husband and wife unlawful;"
or to the "wife of any alien or citizen of another state, living
separate," when she has resided in the commonwealth
three years, the husband "having left the United States with
the intention of becoming a citizen of some foreign country,
and not having during that time" returned to "claim his
marital rights," nor having made suitable provision for her
support.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> With the subsequent addition of two more causes
the tale is complete. Since 1854 any "citizen" may claim
a divorce when without his consent the wife willingly
absents herself "for three years together;" or when in like
manner she has "gone to reside beyond the limits" of the
state and there remained ten years together without returning
to claim her marriage rights.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> These fourteen general
grounds of divorce still appear in the statute-book;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> but it
should be noted that not less than seven of them have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
do with absence or desertion of one or the other of the
persons under various conditions.</p>

<p>At the close of the colonial era and until 1850, it will be
remembered,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the legislature of Connecticut continued to
grant divorces on various grounds; but jurisdiction in most
cases was exercised by the superior court,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> where it still
remains.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Legislative divorce is not prohibited by the constitution;
and it appears to be still permitted by the law. A
recent act provides that "whenever any petition for divorce
shall have been referred to any committee of the general
assembly, such committee may give to the attorney general
reasonable notice of all hearings on such petition, and he
shall thereupon take such action as he shall deem to be just
and equitable in the premises, and he shall appear before
such committee ... whenever in his opinion justice so
requires."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Since 1667, as elsewhere seen, divorce from
the bond of wedlock had been granted for adultery, fraudulent
contract, wilful desertion for three years, and for seven
years' absence without word. To these grounds, in 1843,
"habitual intemperance" and "intolerable cruelty" were
added.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Three more new causes followed in 1849. Divorce
was then sanctioned for sentence to imprisonment for life;
"infamous crime involving a violation of conjugal duty;"
and for "any such misconduct ... as permanently
destroys the happiness of the petitioner, and defeats the
purpose of the marriage relation."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The remarkable
"omnibus" clause last quoted was not repealed until 1878.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The number of causes was thus reduced to eight, and thereafter
no further changes seem to have been made.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the century the supreme court of Rhode
Island has exercised jurisdiction in cases of divorce and
alimony,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> although until 1851, as elsewhere explained, the
legislature retained a share in this power. At the beginning
of the period a marriage might be dissolved for (1)
impotency, (2) adultery, (3) extreme cruelty, (4) wilful
desertion for five years, (5) the husband's neglect or refusal
to provide, or (6) for any other "gross misbehaviour and
wickedness in either of the parties, repugnant to and in
violation of the marriage covenant."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The last clause is
surely broad enough, and no further ground of separation
was found necessary until 1844. In that year (7) "continued
drunkenness" is added.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Seven years later the court is
given discretionary power to dispense with proof of full five
years' desertion and to grant relief in less time.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Finally
the extreme limit of modern legislation is reached in allowing
(8) a decree when either spouse is guilty of "habitual,
excessive, and intemperate use of opium, morphine, or
chloral."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In 1902 the fifth cause in the above series was
modified, a full divorce being then authorized for the husband's
neglect <i>and</i> refusal to provide his wife with necessaries
for at least one year.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> So the century, which began with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
six grounds, ends with but two new causes for the dissolution
of wedlock. In the meantime, however, we have a rare example
of reactionary legislation. In 1882 the policy of nearly
two hundred and fifty years was reversed.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It was then provided
that in future "divorce from bed, board, and cohabitation,
until the parties be reconciled, may be granted for any of the
causes for which by law a divorce from the bond of marriage
may be decreed, and for such other causes as may seem to
require the same."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This sweeping provision is still in force.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The first word in the history of divorce legislation for
Vermont appears in the records of the "assumption" period.
In 1779 the "representatives of the freemen" authorize the
superior court to grant dissolution of the bond of marriage
for the same four causes allowed at that time by the Connecticut
laws, but by implication only the aggrieved person
is permitted to remarry.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This restriction does not appear
in the statutes enacted after the attainment of statehood.
By these the supreme court may grant either spouse a decree
for impotence, adultery, intolerable severity, three years'
wilful desertion with total neglect of duty, or for the usual
term of long absence unheard of.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The same grounds are
retained in 1805, but with one important modification. In
the case of "intolerable severity" it is left optional with the
court whether the decree shall be from bed and board or
from the marriage bond.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This provision, however, was
short-lived, for it seems to have been repealed in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
number of causes of divorce <i>a vinculo</i> in 1839 has increased
to six, but one old ground&mdash;impotence has given place to two
new ones&mdash;actual confinement on a criminal sentence for
three years or more, and gross, wanton, and cruel neglect of
the husband to provide when he is able.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> By the existing
law the same six causes are expressly recognized.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But the
statute contemplates divorce on still other grounds; for it is
provided that libels for causes other than those named shall
be tried in the county where the persons or one of them
resides.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The last word of the period is retrogressive,
decrees from bed and board being restored after an interval
of almost exactly one hundred years. By the act of November
24, 1896, such separations, "forever or for a limited
time," are authorized, as in Rhode Island, "for any of the
causes for which a divorce from the bond of matrimony may
be declared."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Jurisdiction is now vested in the county
courts, each held by an assigned judge of the supreme court,
who may try questions of fact as well as of law.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>



<p>Very naturally the first divorce legislation of Maine is
based largely upon the contemporary laws of Massachusetts;
and her policy in this regard since the attainment of statehood
in 1820 has developed on lines parallel to those followed
by the parent commonwealth, although there are some
interesting divergences in matters of detail. The statutes
of 1821 embody the Massachusetts law of 1786, together
with such subsequent legislation as was still in force. Jurisdiction
is vested in the supreme judicial court. Divorce
from the bond of marriage is allowed for the same two causes
named in that act. Separation from bed and board for
cruelty, utter desertion, and neglect to provide is authorized,
just as in Massachusetts after 1811,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and this kind of divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
existed until 1883. Three new grounds for dissolving marriage
were allowed in 1830. These were five years' wilful desertion,
uniting with the society called Shakers, and sentence to
state's prison&mdash;in each of the latter two cases the term being
likewise five years.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> To these were subsequently added fraudulent
contract and three years' habitual drunkenness such as to
incapacitate either spouse from taking care of the family.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>A radical change was made in 1847. All the foregoing
causes were at once superseded by a sweeping provision
which is without parallel in the previous history of New
England. By an act of that year, amended in one particular
in 1849, any justice of the supreme judicial court, at any
term held in the county of the parties, may grant decrees of
divorce from the bond of wedlock, when "in the exercise of
a sound discretion" he may "deem the same reasonable and
proper, conducive to domestic harmony, and consistent with
the peace and morality of society."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Moreover, to understand
the full import of this law we must take into account
an enactment of 1850. In no case is the libellant then to be
"restricted to the proof of causes happening within the
state," or where either of the persons is "residing within the
state," but he "may allege and prove any facts tending to
show that the divorce would be" just according to the provision
of the law in question.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The act of 1847 remained in
force until 1883,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> when a new statute appeared which completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
transformed the divorce system of Maine. Seven
causes of dissolution <i>a vinculo</i> are prescribed. These are
(1) adultery; (2) impotence; (3) extreme cruelty; (4) utter
desertion for three years; (5) gross and confirmed habits of
intoxication; (6) cruel and abusive treatment; and (7) gross,
cruel, and wanton neglect or refusal of the husband, being
able, to provide for the wife.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> At the same time the decree
from bed and board is abolished; and the decree <i>nisi</i> is
instituted in practically the same form as in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
In 1897 a modified provision as to residence was adopted,
and two years later the law took its present form. The
same seven causes sanctioned by the act of 1883 are retained,
except that under the fifth head the qualifying words are
added, "from the use of intoxicating liquors, opium, or other
drugs."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><i>b</i>) <i>Remarriage, residence, notice, and miscellaneous provisions.</i>&mdash;The
character of a divorce law does not, of course,
depend wholly upon the number of causes for separation
allowed, but in large measure upon the conditions under
which the decree is granted and the safeguards provided to
prevent hasty or clandestine action. Whether or not either
or both of the divorced persons shall be allowed to contract
further marriage, and on what terms, has always been an
important question. The more general tendency of modern
legislation, in the United States and elsewhere, is to allow
entire freedom in this regard, except for a short period after
the decree. But in New England during the century the
matter has been dealt with in various ways. Thus in
Massachusetts, for more than fifty years after the Revolution,
the guilty party to a complete divorce was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
incapable of contracting a legal marriage. This doctrine is
established by later judicial construction of the act of February
17, 1785, in connection with that of March 16, 1786.
"We think it very clear," declares Chief Justice Parker,
interpreting these laws in 1823, that "the marriage of the
guilty party, after a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> for the cause of
adultery, if contracted within this state, would be unlawful
and void. The statutes which we think must have this construction
are not expressed in very intelligible terms, but,
on close examination, we think the intention of the legislature
cannot be mistaken."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In this decision the court
further raises one of the gravest difficulties of divorce legislation
in the United States. The marriage in another state
of the guilty party to a divorce in Massachusetts, under the
laws just considered, is held to be valid, if such marriage is
not forbidden in the state where the new marriage is contracted.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
But will such a marriage be good in Massachusetts,
should the persons at once return to that commonwealth?
This important question, left in doubt by Chief Justice
Parker, was settled in 1829. In the case of Putnam <i>v.</i>
Putnam the court decided that if a man, "being a resident
in this state for the sake of evading the law, goes into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
neighboring state where such a marriage is valid, and is
there married and immediately returns and continues to
reside here, the marriage is valid here, and after his death
his widow is entitled to dower in his estate."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Gradually the stringency of the early Massachusetts rule
was relaxed. An act of 1841 declares that whenever a divorce
from the bond of matrimony "shall be decreed for
any of the causes allowed by law, the guilty party shall be
debarred from contracting marriage during the life-time" of
the other, subject for disobedience to the penalty prescribed
for "polygamy."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Twelve years later, by leave of the court,
in case of divorce for desertion, the offending spouse is
allowed to remarry.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A further step is taken in 1855. In
all cases, except for adultery, the court is then empowered,
on petition and proper notice, to allow the person against
whom a decree has been granted to marry again.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In 1864
a new rule appears. Three years must now elapse in all
cases, not excepting a decree for adultery, before such permission
may be granted.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Still later all restriction as to
time is removed,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but as the law now stands, the offending
person, without petition to the Court, may again marry after
an interval of two years from the date of the absolute decree.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The early laws of Maine show no restraints upon remarriage
after divorce, but since 1883 the Massachusetts
precedent has been followed, with some interesting variations.
In case of collusion, where both persons are guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
adultery, no separation will be allowed. After obtaining
the final decree, the person in whose favor it is granted may
not marry within two years without the court's permission.
Within that period the adverse party is absolutely forbidden
to remarry; nor may he do so thereafter without the court's
consent.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> There is also a unique provision for a new trial.
Within three years after a judgment has been rendered, a
rehearing as to divorce may be had in case the persons have
not cohabited nor either of them contracted a new marriage
during the period. Moreover, if either has married again,
such new trial may be "granted as to alimony or specific
sum decreed" when "it appears that justice has not been
done through fraud, accident, mistake, or misfortune."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>During the "assumption" period the popular assembly
of Vermont followed the Connecticut rule as it then stood,
allowing only the innocent person to contract a new marriage.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
But from 1797 onward the laws of the state grant entire
freedom to either spouse in this regard.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> At present the
"libellee" is not permitted "to marry a person other than
the libellant for three years," unless the latter dies.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The other states have been less conservative. By the
New Hampshire law of 1840, already noticed, divorce from
the bond of marriage is allowed to the "innocent party" in
case of felony, drunkenness, and the other causes there
assigned.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> This provision is still retained;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but either person
may remarry. So also by the Connecticut law previous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
1849 it is the "aggrieved" who is to be counted as "single"
and able to marry, while at present no such limitation
appears. Rhode Island has been even more liberal. At no
time during the century, apparently, has the legislature
placed any conditions upon the remarriage of either party to
a divorce decreed for any cause, except that in 1902 it was
provided that no decree shall become final and operative
until six months after trial and decision.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Clandestine divorce is an evil as notorious, if not so
harmful, as clandestine marriage. To prevent it the New
England states have been fairly prudent in their regulation
of "residence" and "notice." By the existing law of Massachusetts,
a divorce will be granted for any lawful cause,
occurring in the state or elsewhere, when the libellant has
lived for five years in the commonwealth; or, when the parties
were inhabitants of the state at the time of the marriage,
if the libellant has been such an inhabitant for three years
before the libel was filed, provided neither person came into
the state for the purpose. With this exception, as expressly
provided in the statute, a divorce will not be granted for any
cause, if the parties have never lived together as man and
wife in the commonwealth; nor for any cause occurring in
another state or country, unless, before it occurred, they had
so lived together in the commonwealth, and one of them
was there living at the time it took place. A divorce lawfully
decreed in another state or country is recognized as
valid. On the other hand, when an inhabitant of the commonwealth
goes outside the state to obtain a divorce for a
cause which occurred in the state while the persons there
resided, or for a cause which would not be recognized as
lawful therein, the "divorce so obtained shall be of no force
or effect" in the commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Proceedings for a divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are not barred, however, when the "libellee has been continuously
absent for such a period of time and under such
circumstances as would raise a presumption of death."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Similar provisions exist in the other states, although
sometimes they are less severe. The New Hampshire court
has jurisdiction in matters of divorce under three alternate
conditions: (1) when both parties are domiciled in the state
when the libel is filed; (2) when the plaintiff is so domiciled
and the defendant is personally served with process in the
state; and (3) when either of the parties is domiciled in the
state at the commencement of the suit, and has actually
resided there for the year preceding.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> In Rhode Island the
term of prior residence for the petitioner is two years.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> As
early as 1805 in Vermont a three-years' residence was
required in order to obtain a divorce; and a decree would
not be granted for any cause occurring before the applicant
became a resident of the state.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The term was reduced to
one year in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> As the law stood in 1863, the requirement
as to residence was still defective. "Such divorce for
adultery, intolerable severity, and wilful desertion for three
years may be granted when the causes happened while
residing in another state or country if the libellant has
resided in the state two years previous to the term of
court to which the petition is preferred."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> An attempt was
made in 1878 to put a check upon the increasing number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
divorces by prescribing more careful conditions. No divorce
is henceforth to "be decreed for any cause, if the parties
have never lived together as husband and wife" in the state,
nor unless the libellant shall have resided there "one full
year next preceding the filing of the libel in court." Furthermore,
no divorce may be granted for any cause "which
shall have accrued in any other state or country, unless one
of the parties was then living in the state, and unless before
such cause accrued the parties had lived together in this
state as husband and wife.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In substance this law is still in
force, though the present provisions are more precise. A
divorce may not be granted "for any cause which accrued in
another state or country before the parties lived together in
this state as husband and wife, and while neither party was
a resident of this state, unless the libellant shall have resided
in this state at least one year and in the county where the
libel is preferred at least three months next before the term
of the court to which the libel is preferred."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The statutes
of Maine authorize divorce for any legal cause, if the persons
were married in the state; or if they cohabited there after
marriage; or if the libellant resided in the state when the
cause of action occurred, or had so resided for one year prior
to the commencement of the suit; or if the libellee is a resident
of the state when suit is brought.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> With regard to
foreign divorces and divorces obtained outside the state by
inhabitants thereof, the law of Maine is identical with that
of Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Throughout the century Connecticut
has maintained a high standard in this regard. With some
qualifications, three years' prior residence has always been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
required of a petitioner coming into the state from abroad.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
As the law now stands, a complaint will be dismissed unless
the complainant has continuously resided in the state for
the preceding three years, except when the cause of divorce
arose subsequently to his removal into the same; or unless
the defendant had in like manner there resided for three
years, and actual service was made upon him; or "unless the
alleged cause is habitual intemperance, or intolerable cruelty
and the plaintiff was domiciled in the state at the time
of the marriage," and before bringing the complaint has
returned with the intention of there remaining.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Provision is likewise made by statute for proper notice
to the defendant. Usually much freedom in this regard is
left to the court. Thus in Maine, when the residence of the
defendant can be ascertained, it must be named in the libel;
and if the defendant lives out of the state, notice is to be
made in such manner as the court may order. When the
residence of the defendant is not known to the plaintiff and
cannot be ascertained, the fact must be alleged under oath
in the libel.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> According to the Connecticut statute, the
person aggrieved may make complaint to the court "in the
form prescribed for civil actions, which shall be duly served
on the other party, and whenever alimony is claimed, attachments
to secure the same may be made by direction in the
suit, or by an order pending suit in the same manner as in
other civil actions." But when the adverse party resides
out of the state or is absent from it, or his whereabouts is
unknown to the plaintiff, "any judge or clerk of the supreme
court of errors, or of the superior court, or any county commissioner,
may make such order of notice to the adverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
party as he may deem reasonable." Then "such notice
having been given and duly proved," if the court finds that
the defendant has actually received it, the suit may go on;
otherwise the court may either "hear the case, or, if it see

reasonable, and continue the complaint until the order is
complied with."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In no case may a complaint be heard or
a decree rendered until after the expiration of ninety days;
except when the defendant appears in person or by counsel,
when the complaint is to be treated as "privileged" and
assigned at once for trial.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> By the Vermont act of November
26, 1884, designed to "diminish the frequency of
divorces," it is provided that "at the term succeeding the
term at which the cause is entered, or at any subsequent
term to which the cause may be continued, the same shall
not be heard unless the libellee is present, except in cases
when it is proven to the court that the libellant has, in good
faith, attempted to procure the attendance of the libellee
and has been unable to do so." In this last event the court
may in its discretion proceed to try the case, postpone the
hearing in the hope of securing the presence of the libellee,
or it may require the latter's deposition.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This provision
was repealed in 1886.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> By the present law, when the
"libellee is without the state, the libellant may file his libel
in the office of the clerk of the court in the county where the
same is required to be brought, and such clerk shall issue
an order stating the substance of the libel or petition, and
requiring the adverse party to appear on the first day of the
next stated term of the county court" and make answer.
This order the libellant "shall cause to be published in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
newspaper as is directed by the order, three weeks successively,
the last publication to be at least six weeks previous
to the commencement of the term at which the libellee is
required to appear." Should the libellee not appear, and
"the notice of the pendency of the libel is considered by the
court defective or insufficient, it may order further notice to
be given."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Massachusetts likewise has a recent provision as to notice.
"When the adverse party does not appear," declares the act
of 1898, "and the notice of the pendency of the libel is considered
by the court to be defective or insufficient, it may
order such further notice as it may consider proper." This
statute further provides that "in all libels for divorce where
the cause alleged is adultery, the person alleged to be <i>particeps
criminis</i> with the libellee may appear and contest the
libel."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Similar rules have been adopted by other states.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Any serious attempt to go into the intricacies of divorce
law and procedure would, of course, here be out of place.
Every phase of the subject, as illustrated by the decisions
and practice of the various state courts, is treated with
sufficient fulness and remarkable clearness in Bishop's work
on <i>Marriage, Divorce, and Separation</i>, but a few details of
more general interest may be mentioned. As a rule, the
legitimacy of the children, with the right of inheritance, is
not affected by a divorce, even when it occurs for the adultery
of the mother, but that question is left for separate determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by the courts in the usual way.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> So also when a
supposed second marriage is dissolved, because entered into
by mistake while the former wife or husband was living, the
children are regarded as the legitimate issue of the parent
who at the time of the marriage was capable of contracting,
provided the union was made in good faith.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> When the
validity of a marriage or the effect of any former decree of
divorce or nullity is doubted, the question may be tried by
the court on filing a libel, as in case of divorce.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Sometimes
the husband and wife are expressly allowed to be witnesses
in the suit;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> or the statute may grant trial by jury at the
election of the parties.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Usually the court may authorize
the wife to resume her maiden name;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and occasionally it is
empowered to change the name of the minor children.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><i>c</i>) <i>Alimony, property, and custody of children.</i>&mdash;During
the pendency of a suit for divorce the court is authorized to
make orders forbidding the husband to put any restraint upon
the personal liberty of the wife, and for the care and custody
of the minor children. At the same time it may require the
husband to deposit money to enable the wife to maintain or
defend the libel;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and just provision may also be made for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
temporary alimony or support.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Vermont grants the county
court authority, when the parents are living separate, though
not divorced, to make orders for the "care, custody, maintenance
and education" of the minor children. Similar
orders relating to the children and for the support of the
wife, in that state, may be made when without just cause a
husband "fails to furnish suitable support to his wife, or has
deserted her, or when the wife, for a justifiable cause, is
actually living apart from her husband."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In like manner,
in all the states, the court may make proper orders for the
care, custody, and education of the children after the divorce,
and for permanent alimony to the wife. In Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Massachusetts alimony, or an allowance in
the nature of alimony, may be decreed to the husband as
well as to the wife.</p>

<p>A divorce for the cause of adultery committed by the
woman, by the Massachusetts statute, does not affect her
title to her separate real and personal estate during her life,
except that the court may award the man a just share of it
for the support of the minor children decreed to his custody.
Should the divorced wife marry again, the former husband's
interest in such separate estate, after her death, ceases,
except as thus required for the children's alimony. After
divorce the wife is not entitled to dower; unless the cause be
the husband's infidelity or his sentence to confinement at
hard labor; and except when the husband dies before a
decree <i>nisi</i>, granted on the wife's petition, has become absolute.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
The Massachusetts law, as thus broadly outlined, is
typical of that which prevails throughout New England,
although there are some important variations in matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
detail.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The Vermont statute, in particular, is very clear and
elaborate in its provisions. "Upon the dissolution of a
marriage, by a divorce or decree of nullity, for any cause
except that of adultery committed by the wife," the latter is
entitled to the immediate possession of her real estate. In
all cases "the court may decree to the wife such part of the
real and personal estate of her husband, as it deems just,
having regard to the circumstances of the parties respectively;
and it may require the husband to disclose on oath,
what real and personal estate has come to him by reason of
the marriage, and how the same has been disposed of, and
what portion thereof remains in his hands." There is also
provision for placing the property awarded the wife in the
hands of trustees in her behalf.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Finally, it may be noted, that only in recent years have
any of these states made any adequate provision for gathering
and publishing the statistics of divorce.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<h4>II. THE SOUTHERN AND SOUTHWESTERN STATES<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></h4>

<p><i>a</i>) <i>Legislative divorce.</i>&mdash;In the South, as elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
shown, divorces were at no time granted during the provincial
era. Even the provisions of the English ecclesiastical
law were not in force, because tribunals competent to administer
them were not created. Separation by mutual consent,
or some sort of separate maintenance, was the only kind of
relief then obtainable. Indeed, after independence was
declared, it was more than half a century in Virginia and
Maryland, and many years in North Carolina, before the
courts were granted even partial jurisdiction in divorce
causes.</p>

<p>The legislature, however, was not inactive. Conservative
as southern sentiment is supposed to have been regarding
dissolution of the marriage bond, it is precisely in the
South that legislative divorce was tried on the widest scale
and where it bore its most evil fruit. It seems probable
that from the earliest times following the Revolution, in
some of these states, marriages were dissolved by ordinary
bills passed by the assemblies. Of these a few examples
have been discovered, although they are all of relatively late
origin. The earliest appear in the Maryland statutes.
Thus, by the act of December 21, 1790, the marriage
between John Sewall, of Talbot county, and Eve, his wife,
was declared null and void, on the ground, set forth by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
John in his petition, that, having been convicted of bearing
a "mulatto child," his wife with the child had been condemned
to servitude and sold, according to the cruel statute
of 1715 "in such case made and provided."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Another
instance of absolute divorce occurred in 1805. It seems
that on account of his misconduct Archibald Alexander and
his wife Susanna had "mutually agreed to live separate and
apart from each other, and that articles of separation were
entered into between them for that purpose." While they
so lived apart the "said Susanna" took "upon herself the
charge of six children, two of which were the children of
the said Alexander." But, continues the petition, "in the
month of July last there was a well founded report" that
Archibald was dead; and "under this belief" Susanna
formed a second marriage with John Musket. Accordingly,
on their prayer, the legislature declared the former contract
"absolutely and to all purposes null and void," and Archibald
and Susanna "divorced <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>," but
without affecting the rights or legitimacy of the children of
the first marriage.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The session laws for 1806-7 afford five more examples of
absolute divorce. On January 3, 1807, Pamela Sampson
got herself released from her husband George, because they
had long lived "on terms incompatible with the happiness
of the conjugal union, which every day, if possible, increased,
owing to intoxication which deranged his mind."
On the next day Catherine Dimmett, finding herself in the
same sad relation with James, her spouse, alleges that she
"considers herself in hourly danger from his violence, as he
not only attempted his own life, by cutting his own throat
in the most barbarous and shocking manner," but has also
repeatedly threatened hers, "thereby showing himself free
from every moral restraint, and prepared for the commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the most desperate and bloody deeds." Moreover, he
remains in "one continuous state of intoxication, and freely
indulges in every species of irregularity;" for all of which
the worthy lawmakers felt justified in granting her prayer.
On the same day, for cause not named, the nuptial tie of
Benjamin and Ruth Fergusson was dissolved, but on condition
that the act shall have no force unless the husband
shall "give bond, with good and sufficient authority, to be
approved by the orphan's court of Baltimore County, ...
for the payment of the sum of thirty dollars <i>per annum</i> to
the said Ruth during her life, so long as the said Benjamin
shall live." In the other two cases no ground is assigned.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>During the following years the legislature was from time
to time appealed to for relief.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In 1830 the first act regulating
divorce appears in the statute-book. This law provides
for judicial process in the initial stages, but leaves the final
action to the assembly. It is made "lawful for any person
who may intend to apply to the legislature for a divorce, to
file a petition, stating the ground of his application, in the
court of the county in which the person from whom he desires
to be divorced resides." Upon the "filing of such petition, a
subpoena shall issue to the party implicated, to appear and
answer the same; and, upon such appearance, it shall be the
duty of the court to issue a commission to a person or persons
therein to be named, to take such testimony as the respective
parties require." This testimony, taken after twenty days'
notice, must be returned to the clerk of the court issuing
the process, who is directed to forward it to the legislature
together with "the petition, answer, and all other proceedings
had under the application."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Still further precautions were taken in 1836. In no
instance, it is declared, may a divorce be granted unless the
persons shall have been <i>bona fide</i> residents of the state for
at least twelve months before application. Furthermore, in
the case of such residents the sanction of two-thirds of each
branch of the legislature is required either for an absolute
or for a limited divorce.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Five years later the preliminary
procedure was changed, and some provision for notice to
non-residents was introduced. Application is now to be
made "to some justice of the peace, who shall thereupon
issue a subpoena directed to some constable or other person,
who shall serve the same on the person from whom the
divorce is sought." After service and return of the subpoena,
either party may, after the lapse of thirty days, proceed
to take testimony before a justice of the peace, if they
both reside in the same county or city, otherwise by deposition,
and transmit it to the legislature at its next annual session.
But when the libellee is a non-resident, or is absent
from the state, the applicant must give at least three
months' notice of his intention to ask the assembly for a
divorce, in some newspaper published in the city of Baltimore.
Such testimony shall be taken on oath before a justice
and transmitted to the legislature as in the case of residents.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The law of 1841 was the last attempt in Maryland to
regulate legislative divorce. The efforts of the preceding
twelve years to devise checks and provide safeguards were
largely unavailing. Division of responsibility between the
court and the legislature, whose effects are so well illustrated
in the case of Georgia presently to be considered, is pretty
sure to result in the removal of all real responsibility. Each
successive year produced an increasing crop of divorces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Thirty-one were granted in 1835, and thirty-six in 1837.
Occasionally the decree is from bed and board; in most
cases it is for absolute dissolution of the marriage bond.
Usually it is curtly expressed in a few words of the statute-book.
Often the cause is not mentioned; although, after
1830, the details in most instances are doubtless to be found
in the judicial papers transmitted to the assembly.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In 1842,
for the first time, full jurisdiction in divorce cases is bestowed
upon the courts. Consequently there is a falling off
in the number of legislative decrees; but they nevertheless
continue to appear in the session laws until the constitution
of 1851 forbids the general assembly to interfere in such
matters.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Virginia anticipated Maryland by fifteen years in granting
to the superior court of chancery full power to hear and
determine suits for absolute and partial divorce. The act
of 1827 names the causes for which alone judicial divorces
of either kind may be granted, and provides for alimony and
custody of the children. But this statute also contemplates
the obtaining of divorce <i>a vinculo</i> through resort to the legislature.
It is provided that "every person intending to
petition the general assembly for a divorce, shall file in the
clerk's office of the superior court of laws, for the county in
which he or she may reside, a statement of the causes on
which the application is founded." At least two months
before the next court, notice must be given to the adverse
party "by personal service," when a resident in the state;
otherwise, by publication for four weeks in "some newspaper
printed in the city of Richmond." Thereupon, "without
other pleadings in writing," the court "shall cause a jury to
be impanelled to ascertain the facts set forth in the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
statement; and their verdict shall be recorded;" but the
confession of the parties shall not be accepted as evidence at
the trial. A certified copy of these proceedings must accompany
every petition presented to the legislature; unless a
divorce from bed and board shall have been previously
granted by the court of chancery, in which case a copy of
the record may be substituted.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Under the law of 1827 resort was often made to the general
assembly,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> until in 1848 an act appeared which, after
granting to Robert Moran a divorce from his wife Lydia,
seeks to abrogate the practice so far as by statute it may be
done. "Whereas," runs the preamble, "applications to the
legislature for divorces <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> are becoming
frequent, and occupy much time in their consideration, and
moreover involve investigations more properly judicial in
their nature, and ought, so far as the legislature can do it,
[to] be referred to the judicial tribunals of the state;" therefore
the courts are granted the same full jurisdiction in absolute
divorce which they already possessed in petition for
separation from bed and board.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This law would not necessarily
have put an end to the evil; for the acts of one legislature
cannot bind those of another; but that was soon
effected by the constitution of 1851, which deprived the
assembly of all authority to hear divorce petitions.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>For a few years North Carolina tried a still different plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for sharing responsibility between the courts and the legislature.
By the act of 1814 full authority to grant separation
from bed and board, for any of the causes therein
named, with alimony to the wife, is conferred upon the superior
court. The same tribunal may also try petitions for
full divorce, dismissing the petition, dissolving the "nuptial
ties or bonds of matrimony," or declaring the contract null
and void, as the case demands; but it is especially provided
that "no judgment, sentence, or decree of final or absolute
divorce" shall be "valid until ratified by the general assembly."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
This condition was, however, removed in 1818;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and
ten years thereafter legislative divorce was entirely abolished,
so far as it was possible to accomplish it by statute.
Because "the numerous applications for divorce and alimony,
annually presented to the general assembly, consume
a considerable portion of time in their examination, and consequently
retard the investigation of more important (<i>sic</i>)
subjects of legislation;" and because "such applications
might be adjudicated by other tribunals with much less expenditure
to the state, and more impartial justice to individuals;"
it is therefore enacted that the superior courts of law
shall have "sole and original jurisdiction" in both kinds of
divorce. From this act it may be inferred that the legislature
had granted divorces on petitions which had not gone
through the courts and come up to it for ratification; and for
causes other than those named in the statute.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> A few years
later, by a constitutional amendment ratified in 1835, the
assembly was deprived of the "power to grant a divorce or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
secure alimony in any individual case;" and the same prohibition
appears in the constitution of 1876.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Until constitutionally prohibited in 1852-53, legislative
divorce also existed in Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The law of 1833 endeavors
to restrict the action of the assembly to cases for
whose trial "before the judiciary" the law has not provided;
and it forbids entirely the hearing of any petition when the
causes for it "shall have accrued since the next two months
preceding the sitting of the legislature." At the same time
notice to the opposite party is made essential. In the case
of residents, two months' written notification is required,
service to be proved by affidavit. If the libellee is a non-resident,
publication in a newspaper for at least three weeks
successively will suffice.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The government report shows several divorces in South
Carolina for the year 1869-70; and these were probably
granted by the legislature, for no divorce statute then existed.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1803 the statutes of the Mississippi Territory
make provision for both kinds of divorce by judicial
sentence; but resort to the legislature is not prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Later, by the constitution of 1817 and the laws thereunder
enacted, it is declared that "divorces from the bonds of
matrimony shall not be granted, but in cases provided for by
law, by suit in chancery;" but it is especially provided that
"no decree for such divorce shall have effect until the same
shall be sanctioned by two-thirds of both branches of the
general assembly."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> This unwise condition&mdash;in substance so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
often appearing in the enactments of the South&mdash;seems to
have lasted only until 1832, when it was omitted in the
constitution framed in that year. In the meantime the
legislature had found plenty of work to do. The session
laws of 1833, for example, contain nine divorce decrees,
passed probably just before the new constitution went into
effect.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Alabama, as a part of the Mississippi Territory, was, of
course, affected by the act of 1803 above cited.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Resort to
the legislature may have been practiced from the beginning.
At any rate, during the existence of the Alabama Territory&mdash;from
1817 to 1819&mdash;ten divorces were thus obtained.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The
people seem to have been so much in love with the custom
that it is sanctioned, on the usual co-operative plan, by the
constitution of 1819. The sixth article of that instrument
requires that all decrees of the courts granting absolute
dissolution of wedlock shall be confirmed by two-thirds of
each house of the assembly, precisely in the same form as
by the constitution of Mississippi two years earlier.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
act of the next year, conferring jurisdiction in such cases on
the circuit courts and defining the causes of divorce, directs
that the record of evidence made by the court in each suit
shall be sent to the speaker of the house of representatives,
who is to open and have it read before the members.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not surprising that these "safeguards" proved as
futile in Alabama as elsewhere. The obtaining of divorces
was facilitated rather than hindered. The number annually
granted mounts apace. In 1822 the record is not yet
formidable, but the session laws show twenty-three cases in
1843, twenty-four in the next year, and not less than sixty-seven
in 1849-50.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> So it seemed necessary to appeal to
organic law for a remedy. The constitution of 1865 therefore
declares that absolute divorces shall only be granted by
a suit in chancery; and that decrees in chancery "shall be
final, unless appealed from in the manner prescribed by law,
within three months" from the date of their enrolment.
This section is repeated in the constitution of 1867; but in
that of 1875 a different provision appears. "No special or
local law," it is now declared, "shall be enacted for the
benefit of individuals or corporations in cases which are or
can be provided for by a general law, or where the relief
sought can be given by any court" in the state.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> From the
terms of this section it may be inferred that in exceptional
cases resort might still be had to the assembly. Accordingly,
in 1883, by legislative decree, we find that Claudia
Shaw, of Macon county, was released from the conjugal
bond and constituted a <i>feme sole</i> for all purposes whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The history of American lawmaking in Louisiana opens
with two divorce decrees passed by the legislative council of
the Territory of Orleans. By the first of these acts, dated
January 23, 1805, and signed by Governor Claiborne, the
marriage of Captain James Stille and Lydia his wife is
dissolved and each is "fully authorized" to "contract in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
matrimony" again whenever to either it "may seem right."
This separation is allowed "in consequence of an unhappy
disagreement, resulting from circumstances of an afflicting
nature," which had prevented the couple from "enjoying
that harmony and domestic happiness which the conjugal
state was designed to produce," and leading them soon after
the marriage "to resolve upon and stipulate for a complete
and perpetual separation."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>This example found frequent imitation both before and
after the state of Louisiana was organized. By March 3,
1827, forty-six legislative divorces had been granted.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> With
these, however, the history of such cases comes to an end;
for, a few days later, exclusive jurisdiction in all divorce
matters was bestowed upon the courts;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and the policy thus
adopted by statute was ratified by the constitution of 1845.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>A federal law in 1886 prohibits legislative divorce in any
of the territories of the United States. Previous to that
date, however, it had existed in Arizona. During the single
session of 1879 seventeen divorces were granted by legislative
decree; and the practice may have continued until
stopped by congressional authority.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Kentucky refrained from any divorce legislation until
1809, when jurisdiction was conferred upon the circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
courts.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But the jurisdiction was not exclusive; for year by
year until 1850, when the usual constitutional interdict appears,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
the session laws show the assembly engaged in passing
divorce decrees.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> In the meantime provision was made
for notice to the adverse party. By the act of 1837, in case
of residents of the state, there must be one month's written
notice in which the ground of the intended application to
the legislature shall be set forth; while, if the defendant is
a non-resident, publication of the notice for four weeks in
some "authorized" newspaper "may supersede the necessity
of personal service." When a divorce is granted on such
application, the wife shall receive back the estate which the
husband had with her at the marriage, unless she has been
guilty of conduct such as by the laws of the state would forfeit
her right of dower; and when the husband's conduct is
the cause of separation, she is entitled to the same share of
his real and personal property as if he were dead.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>A few years later the Kentucky assembly accomplished
a feat which surely "breaks the record" in the history of
social legislation. On the 4th of March, 1843, in one short
act of less than two pages of type the hymeneal bonds of
thirty-seven couples were severed by one fatal clip of the
lawmakers' shears; while, in addition, room is found in the
bill to make provision for the children and to restore the
maiden names of some of the women, but not for any mention
of the causes.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It is in Georgia, however, that the divorce laws and judicial
decisions reveal the strangest vicissitudes and the most
singular vagaries. To understand the course of events it is
essential in the outset to observe two important facts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
common law, it will be remembered,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> was, with certain limitations,
adopted by the state in 1784; and the constitution
of 1798 permits "two-thirds of each branch of the legislature
to pass acts of divorce," but only after the parties shall
have had a fair trial before the superior court, and a "verdict
shall have been obtained authorizing a divorce upon legal
principles."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It would have been hard to select a phrase
more ambiguous than the clause last quoted. Just what
are the "legal principles" referred to? Are they the principles
of the English ecclesiastical law, as constituting a
part of the common law made binding in 1784? Are they
perhaps to be sought in previous enactments of the state or
province of Georgia? No such statutes have been discovered;
and no divorce seems ever to have been granted, unless
by the assembly after the Revolution. With this analysis
of the problem before us, the course of legislation during
the half-century following the adoption of the constitution of
1798 may now be traced.</p>

<p>The worthy lawmaker starts out valiantly. The act of
1802, giving the superior court primary and the legislature
final jurisdiction in petitions for total divorce, as required
by the constitution, is justified in language which seems
grotesque in the light of later experience. Such a measure
is needful, we are assured, not only because there are doubts
as to the powers of the judges in divorce causes without a
statute, but because "marriage being among the most solemn
and important contracts in society, has been regulated in all
civilized nations by positive systems;" and because "circumstances
may require a dissolution of contracts founded
on the most binding and sacred obligations which the human
mind has been capable of devising, and such circumstances
may combine to render necessary the dissolution of the contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of marriage, which dissolution ought not to be dependent
on private will, but should require legislative
interference; inasmuch as the republic is deeply interested
in the private business of its citizens."</p>

<p>The preliminary trial provided for by this act is before a
jury whose verdict must take the following form: "We find
that sufficient proofs have been referred to our consideration
to authorize a total divorce, that is to say, a divorce <i>a vinculo
matrimonii</i>, upon legal principles between the parties in this
case"&mdash;which is an attempt, however awkward, to satisfy the
demands of both law and constitution.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In 1806 a new
statute appears, creating a most intricate procedure. As in
1802, no specific causes are named for either limited or complete
divorce. All petitions coming before the superior court
are to be referred to a "special jury, who shall enquire into
the situation of the parties before their marriage and also at
the time of the trial." They may grant either a conditional
or a total divorce. In the former case their verdict shall
make provision out of the husband's property for the separate
maintenance of the wife and children; and the court
shall cause the "verdict or decree to be carried into effect
according to the rules of law, or according to the practice of
chancery, as the nature of the case may require." The verdict
for absolute divorce is, of course, placed before the
legislature for approval. If the legislature "refuse to pass
a law or to carry the same into effect," either person, on due
notice to the other, may apply to the superior court of his
county to appoint three commissioners who, after proper
inquiry into the circumstances of the parties, by witnesses
when necessary, may allow separate maintenance. The report
of the commissioners to the court is to be entered as its
judgment. Even now the matter is not ended. There is
still a last chance for the discontented spouse. If dissatisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with the judgment, either person may apply for its
modification to the next court, which shall refer the first
report or decree to a commission comprising the original
three members, with two others. The finding of this body
is then entered as the definitive judgment of the court.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Thus the law remained until 1833, except that a form of
oath was prescribed in 1810.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In the meantime an ever-increasing
number of divorce acts appears in the session
laws.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Between 1798 and 1835 at least two hundred and
ninety-one decrees for absolute dissolution of marriage were
granted by the legislature. In the beginning of the period
the average annual output was but four; at the close it had
risen to not less than twenty-eight.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> In one instance the
previous finding of a jury seems to have been thought superfluous.
John Cormick, having fled from Ireland to Georgia
in 1798, before the constitution went into effect, and his
family refusing to accompany him, the legislature, without a
verdict, declared his person and property exempt from the
claims of Eliza his wife as if they were never married, and
John was fully authorized to do all things as if he had never
entered into the matrimonial state.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Another case shows the
Georgia lawmaker a close second in legal economics to his
brother of Kentucky. On December 13, 1816, twenty-one
pairs were set free and the offenders forbidden to remarry in
thirteen lines of print, excluding the names.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In 1833 a remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was therefore sought through an amendment to the constitution.
"Whereas," explains the preamble, whose redundant
adjectives may well be a sign of serious distress, "the
frequent, numerous, and repeated, applications to the legislature
to grant divorces has (<i>sic</i>) become a great annoyance
to that body, and is (<i>sic</i>) well worth their attention," both on
account of the expense and the unnecessary "swelling" of
the laws and journals, and "believing that the public good
would be much promoted, and that the parties would receive
full and complete justice;" therefore it is enacted as a part
of the organic law that "divorces shall be final and conclusive
when the parties shall have obtained the concurrent
verdicts of two special juries authorizing a divorce upon
legal principles."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Unless it be assumed that there was no serious intention
to put a check upon the facility with which divorces could
be obtained, it is almost incredible that a provision so loose
and ambiguous should have been adopted. For the retention
of the phrase "upon legal principles" still left a rich
field for speculation as to the proper grounds of divorce,
total or conditional; and it was equally uncertain whether
the juries could determine the law as well as the facts in
each case. So the courts, apparently, continued to grant as
many divorces without help of the assembly as were permitted
before that body lost its power to interfere.</p>

<p>Affairs continued in this unsatisfactory condition until
1847, when suddenly what proved in the end to be a drastic
remedy was administered in the case of Head <i>v.</i> Head, tried
on appeal from the superior court of Monroe county. The
elaborate opinion of Justice Nisbet in this suit, reviewing as
it does the preceding legislation, is the best source of information
for the history of divorce in Georgia. The case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
arose in a petition for dissolution of the marriage bond on
the sole ground of abandonment of the husband by the wife,
which ground, "it is too plain to admit of question," is not
"recognized as a cause of divorce <i>a vinculo</i>" by the common
law. On the other hand, the counsel for the appellant
argued that by "a fair construction of the constitution of
Georgia, and of the laws enacted to carry it into effect, the
question of a divorce or not, in its totality, is submitted to
the special juries; that they are the sole and final judges in
all cases of what shall be a good cause of divorce, irrespective
of the common law principles." To determine, therefore,
the relative powers of the judge and the jury, and to
discover what are the "legal principles" mentioned in the
constitution, became the dual problem which the court was
called upon to solve. In the outset it is held by the court
that the constitution of 1798 is in restraint of divorce in
three ways: (1) by transferring full jurisdiction in the first
instance from the legislature to the superior courts; for
before that date the assembly had exercised "unlimited
power over the subject;" (2) by restraining the legislative
will through requiring a fair trial before a jury before that
will could be exercised; (3) by "restricting both the courts
and the legislature, as to their power to grant divorces, to
such cases as were grantable upon <i>legal principles</i>."</p>

<p>Disregard of these intended restrictions in the statutes
and in judicial practice had led to most serious evils. The
reasons assigned in the preamble to the amendment of 1835,
Justice Nisbet urges, were not the true reasons which actuated
its authors. That amendment arose "in a conviction
upon the minds of prudent and discerning men, that divorces
under the constitution of 1798 were alarmingly frequent;"
and this was due to the fact that responsibility was divided
between the courts and the legislature. "Under the old system,
the courts but rarely seem to have felt, that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
anything to do with the trial of the divorce cause, other than
to subserve the double purpose of an automaton agent in the
hands of lawyers to present their cases to the juries. Believing
that the legislature, whether for good or evil, had made
the juries the sole arbiters of the law and facts, they could
of course feel no responsibility about the matter, and the
consequence was, as all men know who know anything of our
courts of justice, that divorces were had with flagrant facility;
that some were refused which ought to have been allowed,
and hundreds were granted which ought to have been
refused; and that the event of a divorce cause depended
more upon the fact whether it was defended or not, and if
defended, upon the zeal and ability of counsel, than upon
anything else. Nor was the case essentially different when
it came before the legislature. The legislature, taking it for
granted that the courts had settled all the <i>legal principles</i>
involved, in the majority of cases, with ready acquiescence
affirmed the judgment of the court and divorced the parties.
The wealth and standing of the parties, their political and
social relations, or, perhaps, the personal beauty and address
of a female libellant, controlled in many cases the action of
the legislature." Referring to the statistics of legislative
divorce, above quoted, the court continues: "How fearful
was the ratio of increase! Well might the patriot, the Christian,
and the moralist look about him for some device to stay
this swelling tide of demoralization." But "it is said that
the new mode of granting divorces has not remedied the
evil; that divorces are as frequent under the new as under
the old constitution. This is, we admit, to a great extent
true, and the reason is obvious. It is owing to the wrong
construction of the constitution"&mdash;the submission to the
jury of the whole question of law as well as of fact. The
Georgia legislature was not checked, as in England, by the
record of two preceding trials;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> "and although in France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
divorces by the Napoleonic Code<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> may be granted without
cause, upon mutual consent merely, yet the application must
be made to a judicial tribunal, and the consent is subjected
to constraints, which create great and serious checks upon
its abuse."</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was held by the court that the sole causes
for "divorce in Georgia are those of the common law." For
total divorce, or, more properly speaking, annulment of a
voidable marriage, these causes are "pre-contract, consanguinity,
affinity, and corporal infirmity;" while for a partial
divorce adultery and cruelty are the only grounds recognized.</p>

<p>One cannot help admiring the stern moral courage which
enabled the court to render this decision. At one stroke
and without warning the social standing of hundreds was
put in jeopardy. Those who thought themselves single
found themselves married. Many who may have taken new
partners became liable to actions for bigamy; and their children
were bastards. The justice was aware of his grave
responsibility. "The judgment we have given in this case
is in repeal of the practice of the courts in a majority of the
circuits, and in disaffirmance of the opinion of eminent jurists
upon the bench and at the bar, and in conflict with that
public sentiment which, springing out of, and strengthened
by, the heretofore judicial facility which has characterized
the action of the courts, tolerates and expects divorces for
slight causes." At the same time, however wise, and in the
event beneficent, may have been this judgment, one must
also confess that in its wider bearings it reveals the dangers
for society which may lurk in the unyielding logic of individual
judicial opinion, should healthy public sentiment not
be allowed, at least in some measure, to direct and mold the
decrees of our courts of justice.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The hardships arising from
the decision in question were redressed in 1849 by an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
validating all second marriages formed in consequence of
divorces granted for illegal causes by the courts or by the
legislature; and the same year this extraordinary episode in
social history was brought to a close by a constitutional
amendment declaring that "divorces shall be final and conclusive
when the parties shall have obtained the concurrent
verdicts of two special juries authorized to divorce upon
such legal principles as the general assembly may by law
prescribe."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p><i>b</i>) <i>Judicial divorce: jurisdiction, kinds, and causes.</i>&mdash;Although
during the colonial period divorce laws had not
been enacted, after the birth of the nation the wheels of
legislation, in most cases, were slow in starting. Once set
going, however, they have moved swiftly enough, so that
now a great variety of grounds for dissolution of wedlock
are sanctioned. Under influence of ecclesiastical law and
tradition, conservatism is shown in the retention by nearly
all the older states of so-called divorce from bed and board.
Except in Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Porto Rico, and Texas, partial divorce is still permitted
in all of the commonwealths and territories under
review having any legislation on the general subject; for
South Carolina, except for a brief period, has never by
statute authorized any kind of divorce; and in Florida
separate alimony has the same effect as divorce from bed
and board.</p>

<p>By the Virginia law of 1827, as already seen, absolute
divorce, properly so called, can only be obtained from the
legislature, although the superior courts of chancery are
then authorized to annul voidable marriages.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The same
tribunals, however, are granted full "cognizance of matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
causes on account of adultery, cruelty, and just cause
of bodily fear; and in such cases may grant divorce <i>a mensa
et thoro</i> in the usual method of proceeding in those courts."
They may thus "decree perpetual separation and protection
to the persons and property of the parties;" grant to "either,
out of the property of the other, such maintenance as shall
be proper;" restore "to the injured party, as far as practicable,
the rights of property conferred by the marriage on the
other;" and provide for the custody, guardianship, and support
of the children.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>To the causes for which a limited divorce may be obtained
"abandonment and desertion" was added in 1841, and the
provision authorizing annulments was somewhat modified.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
By the act of 1848, putting an end to legislative interference,
the "circuit and superior courts of law and chancery"
are given authority to grant absolute divorce on the single
ground of adultery, with liberty to both parties to remarry,
or only to the innocent or injured party, as may seem just.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
A statute of the next year allows limited divorce for cruelty,
reasonable apprehension of bodily hurt, abandonment, or
desertion; and these four causes are still in force.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>By the present law, which, with a slight modification in
1872 and another in 1894, has remained unaltered since the
act of 1853, eight causes for complete dissolution of wedlock
are recognized; and jurisdiction in all suits for divorce,
annulment, or separation is vested in the "circuit and corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
courts on their chancery side." An absolute decree
may be obtained (1) for adultery; (2) natural or incurable
impotency of body existing at the time of entering into the
marriage contract; (3) where either party is sentenced to
confinement in the penitentiary; (4) where prior to the marriage
either party, without the knowledge of the other, has
been convicted of an infamous offense; (5) "where either
party charged with an offence punishable by death or confinement
in the penitentiary has been indicted, is a fugitive
from justice, and has been absent for two years;"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> (6) where
either party wilfully deserts or abandons the other for three
years; (7) "where at the time of the marriage, the wife, without
the knowledge of the husband, was <i>enceinte</i> by some
person other than the husband;" (8) or where prior to the
marriage she had been, without the husband's knowledge,
notoriously a prostitute. But it is especially provided that
for the last two causes no divorce shall be decreed if it
appears that the person applying has cohabited with the
other after gaining knowledge of the facts. The same is
true of "conviction of an infamous offence;" and under the
third cause, that of sentence to the penitentiary, a pardon
shall not restore the offender to conjugal rights.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>In West Virginia the circuit court on its chancery side
may grant total divorce for eight causes. Of these the first
four are identical with the corresponding numbers for Virginia.
The rest are: (5) where either party wilfully abandons
or deserts the other for three years; (6 and 7) the same
as the seventh and eighth for Virginia; (8) where the husband,
prior to the marriage, has been, without knowledge of
the wife, notoriously a licentious person&mdash;thus dealing even
justice to each spouse. Furthermore, five grounds of limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
divorce are there sanctioned. The first four are the same as
those existing in Virginia since 1849; and in addition a fifth
cause gives jurisdiction when either the husband or wife after
marriage becomes a habitual drunkard.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Kentucky anticipated by many years the mother-commonwealth
of Virginia in defining the grounds for dissolving a
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Under the act of 1809 the several circuit courts
are authorized to grant total divorce to either spouse (1) for
abandonment and living in adultery, or (2) where the other
has been condemned for a felony in any court of record in
the United States; to the husband, when the wife has voluntarily
left his bed and board for three years with the intention
of abandonment; and to the wife, for treatment so cruel,
barbarous, and inhuman as actually to endanger her life.
To prevent too facile action of the courts, a check is devised
similar to that later adopted by the English law. It is made
the duty of the attorney prosecuting for the commonwealth
to oppose the granting of any divorce warranted by this
statute.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> A new cause of full divorce, analogous to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
allowed in some of the New England states, appears in 1812.
When a man renounces the marriage agreement and refuses
to live with his wife in conjugal relation "by uniting himself
to any sect whose creed, rules, or doctrines require a renunciation
of the marriage covenant, or forbid a man and wife
to dwell and cohabit together," the aggrieved woman may
have a full release; the offender is forbidden to remarry
during the former's lifetime; or the wife may claim separate
alimony and maintenance without divorce.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>No further legislation regarding the grounds of divorce
appears until the foundation of the existing law of Kentucky
was laid in the act of 1843. The present statute presents an
exceedingly complex analysis of causes. "A jury shall not
be impaneled in any action for divorce, alimony, or maintenance,
but courts having general equity jurisdiction may
grant a divorce for any of the following causes, to both husband
and wife": I. To either party: (1) for "such impotency
or malformation as prevents the conjugal relation;" (2)
living apart without any cohabitation for two consecutive
years. II. To the party not in fault: (1) for abandonment
for one year; (2) living in adultery; (3) condemnation for
felony within or without the state; (4) concealment of any
loathsome disease existing at the time of the marriage, or
contracting such afterwards; (5) force, duress, or fraud in
obtaining the marriage; (6) uniting with any religious
society whose creed and rules require renunciation of the
marriage covenant, or forbid husband and wife to cohabit.
III. To the wife, if not in like fault: (1) for confirmed habit
of drunkenness on the part of the husband of not less than
one year's duration, "accompanied with a wasting of his
estate, and without any suitable provision for the maintenance
of his wife and children;" (2) "habitually behaving
toward her by the husband, for not less than six months, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
such cruel and inhuman manner as to indicate a settled
aversion to her, or to destroy permanently her peace or happiness;"
(3) "such cruel treatment or injury, or attempt at
injury, of the wife by the husband, as indicates an outrageous
temper in him, or probable danger to her life, or great bodily
injury from remaining with him." IV. To the husband: (1)
when the wife is pregnant by another man without the
husband's knowledge at the time of the marriage; (2) for
habitual drunkenness on the part of the wife of not less than
one year's duration, if he is not guilty of the same fault; (3)
for adultery of the wife, or such lewd, lascivious behavior on
her part as proves her to be unchaste, without actual proof
of adultery committed.</p>

<p>A judgment of divorce in all cases "authorizes either
party to marry again;" but, by a unique provision, "there
shall not be granted to any person more than one divorce,
except for living in adultery, to the party not in fault, and
for the causes for which a divorce may be granted to both
husband and wife." On joint application of the parties,
every judgment for a divorce may be annulled by the court
rendering it, they being restored to the condition of husband
and wife; but thereafter a second divorce cannot be obtained
for the same cause.</p>

<p>Separation from bed and board may originally have
been obtainable in Kentucky under the common law:<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> but
it does not seem to be noticed by any of the early statutes.
For the first time, by the present code, it may be granted
on any of the grounds which warrant a total divorce, or for
"such other cause as the court in its discretion may judge
sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Previous to 1842 the function of the Maryland courts in
divorce matters was restricted to the preparation of cases for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the legislature. By the act of that year full, though not
exclusive, jurisdiction in both kinds of divorce is conferred
upon the chancellor and upon the county courts sitting as
equity tribunals. Divorce <i>a vinculo</i> is permitted (1) for impotence
of either person at the time of the marriage; (2) "for
any cause which by the laws of the state renders a marriage
null and void <i>ab initio</i>;" (3) for adultery; (4) for abandonment
with absence from the state for five years. The causes
for which divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is granted are (1) cruelty
of treatment; (2) excessively vicious conduct; (3) abandonment
and desertion; (4) in all cases where a total divorce
is prayed for, if the causes proved be sufficient for such
limited decree under the act.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1844 the term of absence
as cause of complete divorce is reduced to three years.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Three years later a fifth cause appears. Complete dissolution
of wedlock is now allowed when the female before marriage
has been guilty of illicit carnal intercourse with another
man without the husband's knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The five grounds
of total divorce thus recognized are the only ones still sanctioned
by the existing code; although under the fourth head
it is provided, in more detail, that a decree shall be rendered
only when the court is satisfied by competent testimony that
there has been uninterrupted abandonment for at least three
years, that such abandonment is deliberate and final, and
that the separation of the parties is "beyond any reasonable
expectation of reconciliation."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Likewise the same four
causes of partial divorce, laid down in 1842, still appear in
the statute-book, and in such cases the decree may be "forever"
or "for a limited time," as shall seem just to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
court. The equity tribunals now possess exclusive jurisdiction
in all divorce matters.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The North Carolina statute of 1814 allows the superior
court to grant either kind of divorce (1) for bodily infirmity,
or (2) for desertion and living in adultery. Separation from
bed and board is likewise sanctioned when "any person
shall either abandon his family or maliciously turn his wife
out of doors, or by cruel or barbarous treatment endanger
her life, or offer such indignities to her person as to render
her condition intolerable or life burdensome."</p>

<p>Previous to 1827, as already noted, the judicial decree
for partial divorce was final, while that for absolute dissolution
of the marriage bond must be confirmed by the assembly.
On the abolition of legislative divorce in that year a
provision was inserted in the statute which seems to have
had the effect of an "omnibus" clause. "All applications
for other causes than those specified" in the act of 1814 for
either kind of divorce "shall be subject to the rules and
regulations provided in said act for the causes therein mentioned,"
thus giving the judiciary the full range which the
assembly had hitherto possessed.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Later this clause took a
simpler form, the courts being empowered to grant divorces
on the grounds named in 1814 and for "any other just
cause."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Six grounds subsequently added are retained in
the present law. The superior courts are now authorized to
decree absolute divorce (1) "if either party shall separate
from the other and live in adultery;" (2) "if the wife shall
commit adultery;" (3) "if either party at the time of the
marriage was and still is naturally impotent;" (4) "if the
wife at the time of the marriage be pregnant" by some other
man and the husband be ignorant of the fact; (5) "if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
husband shall be indicted for a felony and flee the state and
does not return within one year from the time the indictment
is found;" (6) "if after the marriage the wife shall
wilfully and persistently refuse" marital duty for twelve
months; (7) if either spouse shall abandon the other and
live separate and apart for two years; and (8) in favor of the
wife, being a citizen of the commonwealth at the time of the
marriage, if the husband shall remove with her to another
state, and while living with her there shall by cruel or barbarous
treatment endanger her life or render her condition
intolerable or burdensome, should she return to North Carolina
and there reside separate and apart from the husband
for the period of twelve months.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> A divorce from bed and
board may be granted (1) if either spouse shall abandon his
or her family; (2) or shall maliciously turn the other out of
doors; (3) or shall by cruel or barbarous treatment endanger
the life of the other; (4) or shall offer such indignities to the
person of the other as to render his or her condition intolerable
and life burdensome; (5) or shall become a habitual
drunkard.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of one or two peculiar provisions, the
law of Tennessee, enacted in 1799, is similar to that of the
parent state North Carolina, adopted fifteen years later,
although confirmation by the assembly is not required. A
total divorce may be granted by the superior court (1) for
bodily infirmity at the time of marriage; (2) bigamy; (3)
when either consort "hath been guilty of acts and deeds
inconsistent with the matrimonial vow, by adultery, or wilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and malicious desertion or absence without a reasonable
cause, for the space of two years." In all cases the innocent
person may remarry; but when the cause is long
absence, he does so at his peril. For, as in Pennsylvania,
should he contract a second marriage and thereafter the
missing first spouse prove to be alive, a cruel Enoch Arden
clause offers to the "party remaining single" at his return
the option either of having his former wife restored or his
marriage with her dissolved. By the same statute a divorce
from bed and board may be allowed when (1) the husband
"shall maliciously abandon, or (2) turn his wife out of doors;
or (3) by cruel or barbarous treatment endanger her life; or
(4) offer such indignities to her person as to render her
condition intolerable, and thereby force her to withdraw."
In such cases the court may grant the wife alimony, not
exceeding one-third either of the husband's income or of his
estate, as may seem just; and such alimony shall continue
until a reconciliation takes place, or until the husband by
his petition shall "offer to cohabit with her again, and use
her as a good husband ought to do." Then the court may
suspend the decree; or, if the wife refuse, may discharge
and annul it at its discretion. Should the husband after
reconciliation fail to keep his engagements, the decree of
separation is to be renewed and the arrears of alimony paid.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>A new cause was added in 1819, the husband being
allowed a total divorce when the woman at the time of the
marriage was pregnant with a "child of color."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The act
of 1835 recognizes practically the same causes for limited
divorce as were prescribed in 1799, although they are differently
expressed; and the separation may now be granted
"forever" or for a "limited time," as shall seem just and
reasonable to the court. By this statute likewise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
grounds of total divorce are in substance identical with
those of 1799, except that a new cause is added. Whenever
a person has in good faith removed to the state and become
a citizen thereof, and has resided there two years, he may
secure a total divorce should his wife wilfully and without
reasonable cause refuse to accompany him; provided he
proves that he earnestly tried to get her to live with him
after separation and that he did not come to the state for the
sake of procuring the divorce.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> So also in 1840 a female of
good character who has resided in the state during the two
years next preceding her petition, may be released from her
husband for desertion during that period, or for any legal
cause of divorce, although such cause may have accrued in
another state.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Four years thereafter it is declared that a
marriage may be dissolved when one party is "guilty of an
attempt upon the life of the other," either by trying to
poison, "or by any other means shewing malice."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>With some further important changes in 1858 and 1868,
the law of Tennessee, as it now stands, was completed.
Ten causes of absolute divorce are at present sanctioned: (1)
natural and continued impotency of body; (2) knowingly
entering into a second marriage in violation of a previous
contract still existing; (3) adultery by either spouse; (4)
"wilful or malicious desertion, or absence of either party
without a reasonable cause for two whole years;" (5) conviction
of any crime which by the laws of the state renders the
offender infamous; or (6) which by the same law is declared
to be a felony, with sentence to confinement in the penitentiary;
(7) an attempt upon the life of husband or wife by
poison or any other means showing malice; (8) refusal on
the part of the wife to remove with her husband to the state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wilfully thus absenting herself for two years; (9) pregnancy
at the time of the marriage by another man without the husband's
knowledge; (10) habitual drunkenness, when either
spouse has contracted the habit after marriage.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> A limited
divorce, or a total divorce in the discretion of the court, may
be granted to the wife (1) when the husband is guilty of cruel
and inhuman treatment; or (2) of such conduct as renders
it unsafe and improper for her to cohabit with him and be
under his dominion and control; (3) when he has offered
such indignities to her person as to render her condition
intolerable and thereby forced her to withdraw; (4) when
he has abandoned her; or (5) turned her out of doors and
refused or neglected to provide for her support.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> These
causes, it will be noticed, are very nearly the same in substance
as those named in 1799; and, as in 1819, separation
may still be decreed for a limited time.</p>

<p>The history of divorce in Georgia has already been
brought down to 1849, when resort to the assembly was
finally forbidden. By the act of the next year specific
causes for either kind of divorce are for the first time enumerated.
After obtaining the concurrent verdict of two
juries a total divorce may be decreed for (1) intermarriage
within the Levitical degrees of consanguinity; (2) mental
incapacity or (3) impotency at the time of the marriage; (4)
force, menace, or duress in obtaining the marriage; (5)
pregnancy of the woman at the time of the marriage by
another man without the husband's knowledge; (6) adultery
in either of the persons after marriage; (7) wilful and continued
desertion for the term of three years; (8) conviction
of either spouse of an offense involving moral turpitude,
under which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the penitentiary for two years or longer. Besides these,
certain "discretionary" grounds are approved. In case of
cruel treatment or habitual drunkenness on the part of
either, the jury in its discretion may determine whether
the divorce shall be absolute or limited. A general clause
declares that all grounds other than those named in the act
shall "only be cause for divorce from bed and board." In
case of adultery, desertion, cruel treatment, or intoxication,
a decree may not be granted when there is collusion or
both parties are guilty of the same offense.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> At the beginning
of the century, the law of 1850, so far as the causes of full
divorce and the discretionary grounds are concerned,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> is
still in force; while, in addition, the present statute simply
authorizes a separation from bed and board on "any ground
which was held sufficient in the English courts prior to the
fourth of May, 1784."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> By the existing constitution the
superior court still has jurisdiction; and for total dissolution
of wedlock the concurrent verdicts of two juries at different
terms of the court are essential to a decree.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The grounds on which marriage may be annulled or dissolved
were in 1803 first defined for the region of Alabama
by the territorial assembly. The courts having equity jurisdiction
were then authorized to grant total divorce for (1)
intermarriage within the forbidden degrees; (2) natural
impotency of body; (3) adultery; (4) "wilful, continued, and
obstinate desertion, for the term of five years." Bigamous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
marriages were, of course, void from the beginning. Separation
from bed and board was allowed on the sole ground
of extreme cruelty in either of the parties; but in neither
kind of divorce was a decree permitted where there was proof
of collusion.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In 1820, the year after the admission of the
state to the Union, the circuit courts gained jurisdiction and
were given power to render decrees of total divorce, subject
to legislative appeal, on the following grounds: I. In favor
of the husband: when the wife (1) is "taken in adultery;"
(2) has voluntarily left his bed and board for the space of
two years with the intention of abandonment; (3) has deserted
him and lived in adultery with another man. II. In
favor of the wife: when the husband (1) has left her during
the space of two years with the intention of desertion; (2)
has abandoned her to live in adultery with another woman;
(3) when his treatment of her is "so cruel, barbarous, and
inhuman as actually to endanger her life."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The provisions
of this act were considerably modified in 1824;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> but in 1832
they were restored, except that the period of abandonment
for either partner was then fixed at three years.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> A new cause
was sanctioned in 1843, a total divorce being then allowed
for pregnancy of the wife by another man at the time of the
marriage, if without the husband's knowledge or consent;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
and habitual drunkenness on the part of either was added
to the list in 1870.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The basis of the existing law of Alabama was laid in the
act of 1852, although important additions to the causes were
subsequently made. The court of chancery now has power
to grant a divorce from the bond of wedlock according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
following complex scheme: I. In favor of either spouse: (1)
when at the time of the contract the other is "physically
and incurably incapacitated from entering into the marriage
state;" (2) for adultery; (3) for voluntary abandonment for
two years; (4) for imprisonment in any state penitentiary for
two years, the sentence being for seven years or longer;
(5) for a crime against nature; (6) for "becoming addicted
after marriage to habitual drunkenness."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> II. In favor of
the husband: for pregnancy of the wife, as provided in
1843. III. In favor of the wife: "when the husband
has committed actual violence on her person, attended
with danger to life or health, or when from his conduct
there is reasonable apprehension of such violence." The
chancellor is further authorized to decree a separation from
bed and board for cruelty<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in either of the consorts, or for
any cause which will justify a decree from the bonds of
matrimony, if the person applying therefor desires only a
partial divorce.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The law of March 10, 1803, beginning the history of
divorce legislation for Alabama, applies also to Mississippi
during the territorial stage; and, five years after the state
was erected, its provisions, so far as they relate to the causes
and kinds of divorce, were re-enacted in 1822.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In 1840 the
time of desertion to warrant a total divorce was shortened
from five to three years.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Ten years thereafter it was provided
that any person already having a separation from bed
and board may, by application to the chancery court of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
district or the circuit court of the county where he resides,
and producing a transcript of the decree, be divorced from
the bond of matrimony. For the future the same privilege
is extended to each of the parties to a partial divorce when
they "have lived separate and apart from each other for the
term of four years."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> By a statute of 1858 this term is reduced
to three years; and only those who have thus lived
apart after partial separation are now allowed to petition for
the entire dissolution of the marriage bond.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But in 1860,
apparently to meet special cases, a law provides simply for a
divorce <i>a vinculo</i> where the persons, prior to the act, have
lived apart in the state four years without collusion.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> A
peculiar cause, a product of the Civil War, appears in 1862.
The wife is then allowed a complete divorce when her husband
is in the army or navy of the United States or resides
in one of the United States in preference to one of the states
of the Confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> By a statute of 1863 a second marriage
is valid when the first spouse has been five years absent;
and such spouse is to be presumed dead in any question
of alimony arising under the second marriage.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In 1867
any citizen marrying out of the state, whose spouse commits
adultery before his return to the state, may after such return
apply for a total divorce, provided he has not cohabited after
discovery of the offense.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The causes of separation from
bed and board, which had remained unaltered since 1803,
were extended in 1857. A partial divorce is then allowed for
habitual drunkenness, as well as for extreme cruelty in either
person; while the wife is granted the same relief whenever
the husband, being of sufficient ability, wantonly and cruelly
fails to provide for her support; but a decree for partial separation
shall in no case bar the right to full divorce from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bond of wedlock.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> A very important relaxation in the law
takes place in 1871. The two causes of partial divorce just

<p>By the present code of Mississippi, therefore, limited
divorce is not authorized. But courts having chancery
jurisdiction may decree entire release from the marriage
bond to the injured person (1) for natural impotency; (2)
adultery, except by collusion or where there is cohabitation
after knowledge of the offense; (3) sentence to the penitentiary
when there is no pardon before imprisonment begins; (4) wilful
continued, and obstinate desertion for two years;
(5) habitual drunkenness; (6) "habitual and
excessive use of opium, morphine, or other like drug;" (7)
habitual cruel and inhuman treatment;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> (8) insanity or
idiocy at the time of the marriage, if the party complaining
did not then know of the infirmity; (9) previous marriage
with some other person; (10) pregnancy of the wife by
another man at the time of the marriage, the husband being
ignorant of the fact; (11) intermarriage within the degrees
of kindred prohibited by law.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The first statute defining the grounds of divorce for
Missouri was approved in 1807 by the legislature of
Louisiana Territory. Either a full or a partial divorce was
then authorized when either person (1) is naturally impotent;
(2) has entered into the marriage in violation of a "previous
vow;" (3) has committed adultery; or (4) has been guilty of
wilful and malicious desertion, without a reasonable cause,
for four years. The general court may likewise grant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
wife a separation from bed and board when the husband
shall either abandon his family or turn her "out of doors,
or by cruel and barbarous treatment endanger her life, or
offer such indignities to her person as to render her condition
intolerable and thereby force her to withdraw from his
house or family."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This law remained in force until 1833,
when "extreme cruelty" and conviction of an "infamous
crime" were added as causes warranting either the husband
or wife to petition for absolute divorce.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The number is
raised to seven by the revision of 1835, which is silent as to
partial divorce; for "indignities" to the person of either
such as already described are now made a legal ground for
entire dissolution of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Vagrancy<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> of the husband
and habitual drunkenness of either for the space of two
years came next in 1845; and four years thereafter the
introduction of two more causes completed the full quota of
eleven grounds on which total divorce is still allowed by
Missouri law. The act of 1849 authorizes a divorce to the
man when the woman at the time of the marriage, or when
it was solemnized, was pregnant by another person without
the intended husband's knowledge; and to the wife, when
the man prior to the marriage or its solemnization had been
convicted of a felony or infamous crime without the woman's
knowing it when the marriage took place. The benefits of
this cause may now accrue to both persons; otherwise no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
essential change in the statute has been made for half a
century.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>In Florida, since 1828, divorce may be sought only by
bill in chancery; and, since 1885, the equity courts have
had exclusive jurisdiction, granting only complete dissolution
of the marriage bond,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> although in that state separate maintenance
is equivalent to separation from bed and board.
The causes now sanctioned are: (1) intermarriage within the
forbidden degrees; (2) natural impotence of the defendant;
(3) adultery in either party; (4) excessive cruelty; (5)
habitual indulgence in violent and ungovernable temper;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
(6) habitual intemperance; (7) wilful, obstinate, and continued
desertion for one year; (8) a divorce obtained by the
defendant in any other state or country; (9) having a husband
band or wife living at the time of the marriage; (10)
incurable insanity.</p>

<p>The Louisiana code of 1808 provides for the annulment
of marriage on legal grounds; and allows separation from
bed and board (1) for adultery of the wife; or (2) for that of
the husband "when he has kept his concubine in their
common dwelling;" (3) when either has been guilty of
excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages toward the other, if
the ill-treatment is of such a nature as to render their living
together insupportable; (4) on account of a public defamation
by one of the married persons toward the other; (5) for
abandonment; or (6) an attempt upon the life of the other
by either spouse.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1827 the "district courts throughout the state and
the parish court of New Orleans" were given "exclusive
original jurisdiction in cases of divorce," with appeal to
the supreme court. They were authorized to grant total
divorce (1) for adultery of the wife; or (2) for that of the
husband "when he has kept his concubine in the common
dwelling, or openly and publicly in any other;" (3) for
excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages, as conditioned for
separation in 1808; (4) condemnation of either married
person to an "ignominious punishment;" (5) abandonment
for five years when the offender has "been summoned to
return to the common dwelling," as is provided for in cases
of separation from bed and board. It is, however, especially
declared that, except when the cause is adultery or ignominious
punishment, no full divorce shall be granted "unless
a judgment of separation from bed and board shall have been
previously rendered," and unless two years shall have thereafter
expired without reconciliation. But in the two cases
excepted above a "judgment of divorce may be granted in
the same decree which pronounced the separation from bed
and board."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The fifth cause approved in 1827 was supplemented
by a new ground in 1832. Whenever either spouse
is charged with an infamous crime and is a fugitive from
justice beyond the state, a total divorce may be claimed by
the other, without need of a previous decree of separation, on
producing evidence of the actual guilt and flight of the
accused.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> "Habitual intemperance" on the part of either
husband or wife was added to the list in 1855;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and in 1857
the time which must elapse between the decrees for partial
and full divorce was reduced to one year.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> An "omnibus"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
clause comes next in 1870, complete dissolution of wedlock
being then permitted "for any such misconduct repugnant
to the marriage covenant as permanently destroys the happiness
of the petitioner;" but it was repealed in 1877.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, the present law of Louisiana
covering the grounds of divorce&mdash;whose evolution was thus
completed in 1870&mdash;may now be summarized. Absolute
divorce, without need of a previous decree of separation,
is permitted where the husband or wife may have (1) been
sentenced to an infamous punishment; or (2) been guilty of
adultery.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> A limited divorce, which may be followed in each
case by a total divorce after one year, is authorized (1) for
adultery on the part of either spouse; (2) when the other
party has been condemned to an infamous punishment; (3)
on account of the habitual intemperance of one of the married
persons; (4) excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages of one of
them toward the other; (5) for public defamation; (6) for abandonment
on the part of one of the married persons; (7) for
an attempt of one of them against the life of the other; (8)
when the husband or wife has been charged with an infamous
offense and shall have fled from justice, on producing
proof of the actual guilt or flight.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> An important modification
was made in 1898. The person in whose favor a limited
divorce has been rendered may apply and get a full divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in one year, while the adverse party must wait two years before
fore he can secure a similar decree, in the meantime the
wife's right to alimony remaining unimpaired.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The divorce legislation of the "Republic of Texas" has
remained in force with little modification to the present
hour. The district courts still have jurisdiction. By the
act of January 6, 1841, a marriage may be declared null
and void for impotency; and absolute divorce may be granted
as follows: I. In favor of the husband: (1) when the wife
is guilty of adultery; or (2) has left his bed and board for
three years with the intention of abandonment. II. In
favor of the wife: (1) when the husband has left her for
three years with like intention; or (2) has abandoned her
and lived in adultery with another woman. III. In favor
of either spouse for excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages
toward the other, if the ill-treatment is of such a nature as
to render their living together insupportable.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> These three
groups appear unaltered in the present code; and there is
added the following: IV. In favor of either husband or
wife, "when the other shall have been convicted, after marriage,
of a felony and imprisoned in the state prison; <i>provided</i>,
that no suit for divorce shall be sustained" because of
such conviction "until twelve months after final judgment,"
nor "then if the governor shall have pardoned the convict;"
and provided also that the conviction has not been obtained
on the testimony of either spouse.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>The grounds of divorce recognized in the statutes of Arkansas
have been in force since 1838. The circuit courts
may now grant total or limited divorce for the following
causes: (1) when either spouse was at the time of the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and still is impotent of body; (2) when either deserts
the other and remains absent one year without reasonable
cause; (3) when a former spouse was living at the time of
the marriage; (4) when either is convicted of felony or other
infamous crime; or (5) shall be addicted to habitual drunkenness
for the space of one year; or (6) shall be guilty of
such cruel and barbarous treatment as to endanger the life
of the other; or (7) shall offer such indignities to the person
of the other as shall render his or her condition intolerable;
(8) when subsequent to the marriage either person has committed
adultery.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>By act of Congress,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> certain general laws of Arkansas, including
those of divorce, are extended to the Indian Territory;
so the causes just enumerated are there in force.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
Limited divorce does not exist in Oklahoma; but in that
territory the district court may grant full dissolution of wedlock
(1) when either person had a spouse living at the time of
the marriage; (2) for abandonment during one year; (3) for
adultery; (4) for impotency; (5) "when the wife at the time
of the marriage was pregnant by another than her husband;"
(6) for extreme cruelty; (7) for fraudulent contract;
(8) for habitual drunkenness; (9) for gross neglect of duty;
(10) for conviction and imprisonment in the penitentiary for
a felony after marriage.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>"Arizona, from 1871-77, in addition to six ample reasons
for divorce, had an 'omnibus clause' in operation which
is a marvelous piece of legislation." "Whereas," we are
told, "in the developments of future events, cases may be
presented before the courts falling substantially within the
limits of the law, as hereinbefore stated, yet not within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
its terms, it is enacted, that whenever the judge who hears
a cause for divorce deems the case to be within the reason
of the law, within the general mischief the law is intended
to remedy, or within what it may be presumed would have
been provided against, by the legislature establishing the
foregoing causes of divorce had it foreseen the specific case
and found language to meet it without including cases not
within the same reason, he shall grant the divorce." Well
was this called, continues Richberg, "the 'seventh wonder'
of Arizona's divorce code."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>A later statute, somewhat more cautiously, allows the district
court to decree a total divorce (1) when the husband or
wife is guilty of excesses, cruel treatment, or outrage toward
the other, whether by the use of personal violence or any
other means; (2) in favor of the husband when his wife
shall have been taken in adultery; or (3) when she has
voluntarily left his bed and board for the space of six
months with the intention of abandonment; (4) in favor of
the wife when the husband has left her for the same time
with a like motive; (5) for his habitual intemperance; (6)
for his wilful neglect to provide the necessaries or comforts
of life during the same period, having sufficient ability, or
failing to do so by reason of his idleness, profligacy, or
dissipation; or (7) when he shall be taken in adultery; (8)
in favor of either spouse when the other has been convicted
after marriage of a felony and confined in any prison. Suit
on the last-named ground cannot be sustained until six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
months after final judgment, nor when the husband or wife
was convicted on the testimony of the other.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> This law is
superseded by the act of 1903. Absolute divorce may now
be granted on complaint of the aggrieved for (1) adultery;
(2) physical incapacity; (3) conviction and imprisonment for
felony, provided that suit may not be sustained until one
year after judgment and that conviction has not been had on
the testimony of either spouse; (4) wilful desertion for one
year, or for habitual intemperance; (5) excesses, cruel treatment,
or outrages, whether by the use of personal violence
or any other means; (6) to the wife for the husband's neglect
for one year to provide her with common necessaries of life,
having the ability, or his failure to do so because of idleness,
profligacy, or dissipation; (7) to either for the other's conviction
of felony before marriage without the innocent person's
knowledge; (8) to the husband when without his
knowledge the wife was pregnant by another man at the
time of the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>In New Mexico the district courts may grant absolute
divorce for (1) abandonment; (2) adultery; (3) impotency;
(4) when without the husband's knowledge the wife at the
time of the marriage was pregnant by another man; (5) cruel
and inhuman treatment; (6) to the wife for the husband's
neglect to support; (7) habitual drunkenness; (8) conviction
and imprisonment for felony subsequent to the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> does not exist; but in the laws
of 1884 there is a curious provision, which seems designed,
in a truly patriarchal spirit, to soothe domestic ills and
check matrimonial transgressions through intervention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the local magistrate. One is left in little doubt as to the
right ideal of family life, being assured that "the duties and
relations that should exist between married persons are the
following, to wit: The husband is the head of the family;
he, nevertheless, owes fidelity, favor, support, and protection
to the wife; he should make her a participant in all the conveniences
he enjoys; he should show her the utmost and
every attention in cases of sickness, misfortune or accident,
and provide for her the necessaries of life according to his
condition and ability; and the wife owes fidelity and
obedience to the husband; she is obliged to live with him
and accompany him to such place as he may deem proper
and advantageous to make his residence." So when any
difficulty arises on account of failure in any of these things,
the injured person may go before the justice of the peace in
his "precinct and make complaint demanding judicial action."
Then the magistrate "shall forthwith dispatch his compulsory
writ directing the party defendant immediately to appear to
such complaint; both parties being present, it shall be the
duty of the justice to endeavor to effect a reconciliation, the
first of which endeavors he shall enter on record upon his
docket, affording the parties a reasonable opportunity; but
if after having so done, the person making the complaint
does not agree, the justice shall then proceed to try the
matter in a summary manner, provided always, that the
reasons for disagreement are simple, such as non-fulfillment"
of the duties above set forth. In "case of conviction he
shall cause the delinquent to act as required by the laws of
the conjugal relation;" and when there is resistance he
"may order that such person be confined in the county jail,
there to remain until he comply with those duties by which
both the husband and wife were mutually bound." Furthermore,
it is especially provided, that when any persons are
thus put in jail "for an infraction of duty" and fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
"furnish their own provision," the sheriff may "dispose of
their services for their maintenance." Should, however, the
trouble "arise from adultery, or cruelty, or ill temper, rendering
the life of the consort insecure, the justice ...
shall, after due investigation send the case up to the district
court which shall take cognizance of and try the same;"
and "whenever a temporary separation occurs between husband
and wife in order to bring suit before the district
court, the justice of the peace will provide how the family
shall be cared for, and will immediately report to the probate
judge of the county, so that the latter may provide for
the care of the minors, their support and education, as also
for the wife, in case she be the injured party, during the
controversy or until otherwise provided for by the district
court."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> It is not, perhaps, surprising that this whole subject
is omitted from the compilation of 1897.</p>

<p>By the code of Porto Rico the district court has jurisdiction.
Partial divorce is not recognized; but marriage may
be dissolved, on the petition of the aggrieved, for (1) adultery;
(2) conviction of felony, which may involve the loss of
civil rights; (3) "habitual drunkenness or the continued
and excessive use of opium, morphine, or any other narcotic;"
(4) cruel treatment or gross injury; (5) abandonment for
one year; (6) "absolute, perpetual, and incurable impotence"
occurring after marriage; (7) the "attempt of the husband
or wife to corrupt their sons or to prostitute their daughters,"
or connivance of either in the same; (8) the proposal of the
husband to prostitute the wife.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The experience of South Carolina is peculiar. After
abstaining from any legislation on the subject for two hundred
years, that state indulged in a conservative divorce
statute in 1872. Hitherto the courts were competent only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to grant separation from bed and board under the common
law. By the act in question they were empowered to pronounce
decrees of absolute divorce in favor of either spouse
(1) for adultery and (2) for abandonment<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> during the space
of two years.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> But this law was of short duration, being
repealed in 1878.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> South Carolina legal sentiment on the
divorce problem is fairly revealed in connection with two
important decisions during the century. Commenting on
the case of Vaigneur <i>et al.</i> <i>v.</i> Kirk, decided in 1808, Editor
Desaussure contrasts the laxity of the marriage laws with
the stringency of the rule relating to divorce. "The subject
of marriage, and consequently the legitimacy of children,
is on the same loose footing in this state that it was
in England before" 1753<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and as "it now is in Scotland.
We have no statute regulating marriages, or providing any
form for the celebration of them, or for recording them.
And they are usually celebrated in any form the parties
please, before a clergyman or magistrate." This "remarkable
facility of contracting matrimony ... is strongly
contrasted with the impracticability of dissolving the contract.
No divorce has ever taken place within the state.
The legislature has uniformly refused to grant divorces, on
the ground that it was improper for the legislative body to
exercise judicial powers. And it has as steadily refused to
enact any law to authorize the courts of justice to grant
divorces <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>, on the broad principle that it
was a wise policy to shut the door to domestic discord, and
to gross immorality in the community."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>With this view harmonizes the opinion of Justice Pope
in McCreery <i>v.</i> Davis rendered in 1894. While separation
from bed and board&mdash;the only form of divorce obtainable
in the state&mdash;"is a judicial barrier to any attempt to exercise
the rights or enforce the duties of the parties affected
by the judgment, yet the courts are only too willing to have
the parties restored to their original <i>status quo</i>, upon good
cause shown. While the remedy is a hard one, and to a
certain extent interferes with the operation of the laws of
nature, still woman must be protected! After all, an unbending
adhesion to the laws of right living has a healthy
effect upon the lives of others. If self-denial is thus necessitated,
it should not be forgotten that many natures are perfected
through its beneficent influence. True philosophy
would extract good from every condition.... By art. IV,
sec. 15, of our constitution, the courts of common pleas
have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of divorce, and by
art. XIV, sec. 5, divorces from the bonds of matrimony
shall not be allowed but by the judgment of a court as shall
be prescribed by law. Thus the general assembly is denied
the power to grant divorces directly, but is permitted to
clothe the courts of common pleas with that power. This
last they have refused to do by repealing the act of 1872;"
and thus "we have the common law restored to us on this
subject."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Finally it may be noted that the supreme court of the
District of Columbia has exclusive jurisdiction in all applications
for either full or partial separation. Until recently
a divorce from the bond of wedlock might be granted (1)
when either spouse had a husband or wife living at the
time of the contract, "unless the former marriage had been
lawfully dissolved and no restraint imposed" on further
marriage; (2) when the marriage was contracted during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lunacy of either party; (3) when either was matrimonially
incapacitated at the time of the marriage; or (4) has since
committed adultery; (5) for habitual drunkenness for a
period of three years; (6) for cruel treatment endangering
the life or health of the complainant; or (7) for wilful
desertion and abandonment for two years. A divorce from
bed and board was allowed (1) for cruel treatment endangering
life or health; or (2) "reasonable apprehension, to the
satisfaction of the court, of bodily harm."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> A new and
drastic law was passed in 1901. Hereafter absolute divorce
will be granted only for adultery, the guilty person not being
allowed to remarry. Legal separation from bed and board
may be obtained for (1) drunkenness, (2) cruelty, or (3)
desertion. Only residents may bring suit for divorce; and
unless the applicant has for three years been a <i>bona fide</i>
resident, no decree will be granted for a cause occurring
outside the District before such residence began.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p><i>c</i>) <i>Remarriage, residence, notice, and miscellaneous
provisions.</i>&mdash;Throughout the century, and especially during
the first half, many of the southern states have been conservative,
even severe, regarding the liberty of the person
offending to remarry after full separation; but in very
few cases is any restraint put upon the further marriage of
the person in whose favor the decree is granted. The
divorce acts passed by the assembly of Virginia sometimes
expressly forbid the guilty person to contract further wedlock
during the lifetime of the former spouse.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The law of
1848, when the marriage bond is dissolved on account of
infidelity, authorizes the court in its discretion to allow both
parties to remarry or only the injured person, as may seem
just.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Such substantially is the present law. "In granting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a divorce for adultery, the court may decree that the guilty
party shall not marry again; in which case the bond of matrimony
shall be deemed not to be dissolved as to any future
marriage of such party, or in any prosecution on account
thereof. But for good cause shown, so much of any decree
as prohibits the guilty party from marrying again, may be
revoked and annulled at any time after such decree, by the
same court by which it was pronounced."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> No restraint
appears to be put upon the immediate remarriage of persons
separated for other causes.</p>

<p>The early statutes and the decrees for full divorce in
individual cases passed by the assembly of Maryland, by
their silence on the subject, appear to contemplate the further
marriage of the persons at pleasure. The law of 1872,
however, is somewhat conservative. "In all cases where a
divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> is decreed for adultery or abandonment,
the court may, in its discretion," forbid the guilty
party to "contract marriage with any other person during
the lifetime" of the injured spouse, the bond of marriage not
being dissolved, but remaining in full force with respect to
such offender.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> This restriction is now omitted from the
code.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> In the District of Columbia the guilty person may
not remarry except with the former spouse.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Formerly the law of North Carolina was stringent in this
regard. The act of 1814 permits the "complainant or innocent
person" to "marry again as if he or she had never
been married;" leaving us to infer, perhaps, that the
defendant was not allowed such liberty.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In 1828 it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
squarely enacted that "no defendant or party offending, who
shall be divorced from the bonds of matrimony ... shall
ever be permitted to marry again."<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> This rule stands in
sharp contrast with the policy of the later law. First the
prohibition was restricted to the lifetime of the aggrieved.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
Next, in 1869, the term was reduced to two years.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> From
1871 to 1895 no check whatever was put upon the further
marriage of either spouse, whether guilty or innocent;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> but
now in case of wilful desertion the guilty defendant may not
rewed in five years, or during the lifetime of the plaintiff, if
divorced for the eighth cause above considered.</p>

<p>The Georgia statute approved in 1806 allows remarriage
when a contract is nullified under the principles of ecclesiastical
law; but denies the privilege to the person whose
"improper or criminal conduct" is the cause of an absolute
divorce, so long as the innocent consort lives.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> This rule
long remained in force;<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> but under the existing code a rather
peculiar procedure is adopted. The jury according to whose
final verdict a decree of absolute divorce is granted determines
the rights and disabilities of the parties, including the
question of remarriage, subject to the revision of the court;
but provision is made for subsequent removal of the disabilities
thus imposed. On proper application, notice of which
must be published in a newspaper for sixty days, with twenty
days' personal notification to the other divorced person if
still living and residing in the county, the question of granting
relief is submitted to a new jury, "who shall hear all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
facts, and if, in their judgment, the interest of the applicant
or of society demands the removal of such disabilities," shall
so find; and the person relieved shall then be allowed to
form a second marriage as if no former contract had ever
existed. At the trial the divorced person or any citizen of
the county may resist the application; but should no person
appear for this purpose, then "the solicitor-general shall
represent the state, with full power to resist the same, as in
ordinary divorce cases."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>By the Tennessee statute of 1799 no restraint is put upon
immediate remarriage in any case of divorce, except where
the cause is infidelity, when the guilty defendant may not
marry the person with whom the crime was committed during
the lifetime of the former spouse.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> This provision still
appears unchanged in the code.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The offender is dealt with
in precisely the same way by the Kentucky law of 1809; and
by it also the injured spouse is permitted to marry again
only after two years.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> In 1820 the innocent person is
relieved from all restraint;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> both parties are treated as
"single" persons in 1843;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and likewise by the present statute,
in all cases of divorce, no matter what the cause, guilty
and innocent alike are absolutely free to form new marriages
whenever it shall please them so to do.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The same
freedom exists in Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Indian
Territory, Texas, West Virginia, and Missouri; although
in the last-named state until 1885 the guilty defendant was
not permitted to remarry for five years, "unless otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
expressed in the decree of the court."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Since 1857, in
Mississippi, by a more stringent clause "the decree may
provide, in the discretion of the court, that a party against
whom a divorce is granted because of adultery shall not
be at liberty to marry again;" but the freedom of the
successful plaintiff is unrestrained.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In 1824 the Alabama
assembly in all cases forbade the guilty person to remarry;
but this prohibition was removed by an act of February,
1870, which, however, lasted only until April, 1873, when it
in turn was repealed. By the existing code the chancellor
in making his decree may, according to the evidence and
nature of the case, direct whether the party, against whom the
decree is rendered, shall be permitted to marry again; and in
decrees now or hereafter rendered, when no order is made
allowing or disallowing the divorced person to remarry, he may
on petition and proper proof allow or disallow the petitioner to
form a new marriage.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> It is constituted bigamy in Oklahoma
for either divorced person to remarry within six months after
the divorce, or until thirty days after final judgment, if

According to the Louisiana law, since 1808&mdash;at least until

<p>In all of the southern and southwestern states, except
Louisiana and, of course, South Carolina, a short term of residence
is required to qualify the plaintiff to bring suit. Virginia
began with a fairly cautious act in 1848. A definite
term is not fixed; but a petition for divorce must be brought
in the court of the county, city, or town where one of the
parties lives, and when the plaintiff has left the county or
other place where the married persons dwelt together, the
"suit shall be instituted and heard in the court" held for
that same county, if the defendant lives there still. The
benefits of the act do not extend to any save <i>bona fide</i> citizens
at the time of petition; nor to any case where the parties
have never lived together as citizens and as married persons
in the commonwealth; nor to any cause of adultery which
shall have occurred in any other state or country, unless the
parties at the time of such cause or before it took place were
citizens of the state and lived there together as husband and
wife.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> By the present law no suit can be sustained unless
one of the persons has been domiciled in the state for at least
one year before; and it must be brought either in the county<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
or corporation where the parties last cohabited, or, at the
option of the plaintiff, in that of the defendant, if still a resident
of the state; otherwise in the place where the plaintiff
dwells.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The same rule as that of the parent state has existed in
West Virginia since 1882, when a year's residence of one of
the persons instead of mere residence at the time of the filing
of the suit was introduced.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In Georgia twelve months in
the state and six in the county for a divorce of either kind
are required.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> By the laws of Kentucky and Arkansas the
term of previous residence for the plaintiff is also one year;
and if the cause for divorce arose or existed without the state,
he must have been a resident of the state at the time, unless
it was also a ground of divorce where it existed or arose. In
each of these states "an action for divorce must be brought
within five years next after the doing of the act complained
of."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> In Alabama, when the defendant lives outside the
state, the plaintiff must have been a <i>bona fide</i> resident for
one year before bringing the action; or for three years when
abandonment is the cause alleged.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Since 1822 in Mississippi
the term of residence in the state for the applicant has
been one year;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> although, in 1857, a divorce shall be denied
when the parties have never lived together as husband and
wife in the state; as also for a cause occurring elsewhere,
unless prior to its occurrence they have so dwelt together in
the commonwealth. This last restriction does not apply to a
<i>bona fide</i> citizen who marries abroad and does not discover
the cause of divorce until after return to the state; but in
case of desertion the term of <i>bona fide</i> residence must be
three years.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> An important change was introduced in 1863.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
It is then sufficient to be a citizen of the state or a resident
of it for one year; but the applicant must make affidavit that
he has not taken up residence to obtain a divorce.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> By the
existing code the courts of chancery may exercise jurisdiction
only (1) when both persons are domiciled in the state when
suit is commenced; or (2) when the complainant is so domiciled
and the defendant is personally served with process in
the state; or (3) when one of the consorts is thus domiciled
and one or the other of them an actual resident for one year
before action began.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

the District of Columbia; and two years in Florida.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> It is
also two years in Tennessee, although the acts complained of
were committed out of the state, or the petitioner lived out
of the state at the time, and no matter where the defendant
resides. A decree of divorce in a foreign state granted to a
citizen of Tennessee who has merely temporarily transferred
his residence there is void and will not be recognized.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In

plaintiff must show that the facts constituting the ground
for divorce have existed for at least six months prior to filing
the complaint, and that he has been a resident of the state
for the preceding two years; and if the wife be plaintiff,
she may set forth "that the husband is removing or about
to remove his property and effects from the state, whereby
she may be disappointed in her alimony."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> But in case

is one year, unless the offense or injury complained of was
committed within the state, or when one or both of the persons

<p>A few of the states under consideration have adopted
special provisions governing notice to the defendant. Thus
in Louisiana, "when the defendant is absent, or incapable of
acting for any cause, an attorney shall be appointed to represent
him, against whom, contradictorily, the suit shall be
prosecuted."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> In North Carolina, if personal service cannot

any other actions.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> By the law of Tennessee, process is
authorized as in chancery cases. If the wife is the petitioner,
the suit may be heard and decided without service, either
personal or by publication, if the bill was filed and the
subpoena placed in the hands of the sheriff of the county in
which the suit is instituted three months before the time
when the subpœna is returnable; but the officer having the
subpœna shall execute it if he can.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In New Mexico service
of process can be made by publication after obtaining an
order from a judge of the supreme court, based on an
affidavit showing the present residence of the defendant, if
known, or last known place of residence, and efforts made
to ascertain the present residence. The order for publication
shall direct that a copy of the summons be mailed to
the present or last known residence of the defendant, and
may direct such other means of bringing the action to the
knowledge of the defendant as the judge shall deem proper.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
Until recently Florida had a still different law. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
defendant is absent from the state, so that ordinary process
cannot be served, or, if served, he cannot be compelled
to appear and answer or plead, the court may order a hearing
on the bill, a copy of such order to be published in
some public newspaper of the state, for the space of three
months at least, or for a longer time, if the court shall so
direct, or a copy of the bill and order for the hearing, certified
by the clerk of the court, shall be actually served upon
or delivered to the defendant at least three months before
the day fixed for the hearing, or for a longer time, as the
court may determine. The present statute, however, directs
simply that process be served as in other chancery suits.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
This is the rule also in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,
Mississippi, Arkansas, and Indian Territory; likewise in
Georgia when the defendant is a non-resident; and in Alabama,
where, if the defendant is a non-resident, publication
is essential.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In the District of Columbia process is according

<p><i>d</i>) <i>Alimony, property, and custody of children.</i>&mdash;The
statutes of these states contain the usual provisions for the
protection and support of the wife and children during the
suit for divorce; and sometimes the husband is required to
furnish money to defray the wife's expenses in the same.
The Virginia law authorizes the court in term or the judge
in vacation to make an order compelling the "man to pay
any sums necessary for the maintenance of the woman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to enable her to carry on the suit, or to prevent him from
imposing any restraint on her personal liberty, or to provide
for the custody and maintenance of the minor children"
during the litigation. In the same way steps may be taken
to preserve the estate of the husband, "so that it may be
forthcoming to meet any decree," even compelling him to
give security to abide by the decision.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> North Carolina also
grants the wife alimony <i>pendente lite</i>; but an order allowing
it shall not be made "unless the husband shall have had five
days' notice;" and in all cases of application for alimony it
is admissible for him to be heard by affidavit in answer to
the allegations made by the complainant. If he has
abandoned his wife and left the state, or is in parts unknown,
or is about to remove or dispose of his property for the purpose
of defeating her claims, a notice is not required.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Arkansas and Indian Territory allow similar support during
the suit, including attorney's fees.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> By the Louisiana
statute, "if the wife who sues for a separation" from bed
and board, or for a divorce, "has left or declared her intention
to leave the dwelling of her husband, the judge shall
assign the house wherein she shall be obliged to dwell until
the determination of the suit." She "shall be subject to
prove her said residence as often as she may be required to
do so, and in case she fails so to do, every proceeding on the
separation shall be suspended." She is entitled to alimony
<i>pendente lite</i>, if she constantly resides in the house assigned;
and during the action, for the preservation of her rights, she
may require an inventory and appraisement to be made of
the property in the husband's possession and demand an
injunction restraining him from disposing of any part
thereof. After the commencement of the suit the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
may not contract a debt on account of the community, nor
sell the immovables belonging to the same; such alienation
being void, if made "with the fraudulent view of injuring
the rights of the wife." Custody of the children of the
marriage, "whose provisional keeping is claimed by both
husband and wife," belongs to the husband, whether plaintiff
or defendant, "unless there shall be strong reasons to deprive
him of it;" but when a separation from bed and
board has been decreed, the "children shall be placed under
the care of the party who shall have obtained the separation,
unless the judge shall, for the greater advantage of the
children and with the advice of the family meeting, order
that some or all" of them be intrusted to the other spouse.
In all cases of full divorce "the minor children shall be
placed under the tutorship of the party who shall have
obtained" the decree.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Permanent alimony and the custody of the children after
dissolution of marriage are generally provided for. Sometimes
the wife is granted separate alimony without a decree
of divorce, as in Virginia, Florida, Georgia, and Oklahoma.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
From an early period the North Carolina statutes have been
conspicuous for the relief granted to the wife after divorce,
or, under certain circumstances, without formal separation.
Thus by the act of 1814 the court may grant a woman having
a limited divorce for cruelty or abandonment such alimony
as the husband's means will admit, not exceeding
either one-third of his real or personal estate or a like
share of the annual profits of his estate, occupation, or labor.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
The deserted wife gains still further protection in 1816.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Whereas," declares an act of that year, "cases of great
hardship often occur, the husband being at liberty to return
and squander away the estate of the wife, subsequently
obtained;" to remedy the evil it is therefore enacted that in
future the decree of separation from bed and board shall
have the effect of securing to the wife "any property which
she may subsequently obtain, either by her own labor, gift,
devise, or operation of law, unless the court shall in their
judgment otherwise order."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Furthermore, in 1828-29 the
courts were authorized to grant the wife separate alimony
without divorce "whenever a man shall become an habitual
drunkard or spendthrift, wasting his substance to the impoverishment
of his family."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The present law is conceived in
the spirit of these early enactments. In case of separation
from bed and board, the amount of alimony is the same as
in 1814. Separate maintenance without a divorce is still
allowed. "When any husband shall separate himself from
his wife and fail to provide her with the necessary subsistence
according to his means and condition in life, or if he
shall be a drunkard or spendthrift, the wife may apply for
a special proceeding to the judge of the superior court for
the county in which he resides, to have a reasonable subsistence
secured to her and to the children of the marriage."
Finally it may be noted that alimony may be decreed to the
husband as well as the wife in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>

<p>Measures are taken in nearly every state for the division
or other disposal of property after separation or divorce.
The North Carolina law is very elaborate. "Every woman
who shall be living separate from her husband, either upon
a judgment of divorce ... or under a deed of separation,
executed by said husband and wife, and registered in the
county in which she resides, or whose husband shall have
been declared an idiot or a lunatic, shall be deemed and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
... a free trader, and shall have power to convey her
personal estate and her real estate without the assent of the
husband." So also "every woman whose husband shall
abandon her, or shall maliciously turn her out of doors, shall
be deemed a free trader, so far as to be competent to contract
and be contracted with, and to bind her separate property,
but the liability of the husband for her reasonable
support shall not thereby be impaired, and she shall have
power to convey" her real and personal estate without her
husband's assent. When a marriage is dissolved <i>a vinculo</i>,
each of the parties loses all right to any estate by courtesy
or dower, and all right to a year's provision or a distributive
share in the personal property of the other, or to
administer on the other's estate, and all rights whatsoever
in the other's estate gained by settlement in consideration
of the marriage. But if a "married woman shall elope with
an adulterer, or shall wilfully and without just cause abandon
her husband and refuse to live with him, and shall not be
living with" him at his death; or if a limited divorce be
granted on the husband's petition, "she shall thereby lose all
right to dower in the lands and tenements of her husband, and
also all right to a year's provision." In such cases the husband
may convey his real estate as if he were unmarried, and
the wife is thereafter barred of all claims to dower. When
the husband is guilty of a similar offense, and his conduct is
not condoned by the wife, or in case a partial divorce has been
granted on her application, he shall suffer the like penalties.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>In Missouri a divorce obtained by the wife is considered
in law as the death of the husband, and she is looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as his widow; but when at fault she is barred of dower.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
The guilty wife loses her right of dower also in Tennessee;
and there she cannot claim permanent alimony. In the
same state, when divorce is for the wife's infidelity, and the
woman afterwards cohabits with her paramour, she is made
"incapable of alienating, directly or indirectly, any of her
lands;" and after her death these are to be distributed
according to the rules of intestate inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Dower is
barred by grant of permanent alimony in Georgia;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and in
Louisiana, in case of separation from bed and board, the
defendant loses "all the advantages or donations" which the
plaintiff "may have conferred by the marriage contract or
since," while the latter preserves all those to which he or she
would otherwise have been entitled; and these dispositions
are to take place even when the advantages and donations
were "reciprocally made."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Finally it must be noted as a matter of regret that in no
instance in these states has any provision been made for the
registration of divorces or the return and publication of
divorce statistics.</p>

<h4>III. THE MIDDLE AND WESTERN STATES<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></h4>

<p><i>a</i>) <i>Legislative divorce.</i>&mdash;An examination of the session
laws reveals the fact that legislative divorce has at some time
existed in many western commonwealths. During the territorial
stage, in particular, and in some cases for a considerable
period thereafter, the assemblies at each meeting were
called upon to hear and determine petitions for dissolution
of marriage which ought to have been relegated to the
courts. Such, for example, was the practice in Michigan
until 1837, when it was forbidden by the first constitution
of the state;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and in Illinois until a later time. At the
session of 1817-18 the assembly of Illinois Territory
granted relief to Elizabeth Spriggs because she had been
"shamefully abandoned" by her husband, who, it is alleged,
is still guilty of "shameful" misconduct, and because she
must be "considerably injured if she cannot obtain a divorce
sooner than in the ordinary way."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Other cases
occurred from time to time;<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and in 1831 the marital bonds
of twenty couples were dissolved by one act of a few lines.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
Indiana appears to have been nearly as indiscreet. For
instance, in 1838 the marriage of John Duvall and Nancy
Duvall, <i>alias</i> Nancy Stack, was declared null and void.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
Two years later occurred a divorce from the bond of wedlock,
the wife being permitted to resume her maiden name.
Thereafter it became the practice in this state for the
assembly to grant persons leave to file bills in the courts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
cases where the prescribed causes for divorce by judicial
process did not exist. Thus in 1842 Mary Ann Bruner was
allowed to file a petition because of "her disability by reason
of her husband not having absented himself from her
for two years," the full term necessary to constitute a valid
ground according to the statute.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Until 1851, when the constitution
put a stop to this evil custom, many such applications
were referred to the circuit courts, the full legal requirement
being similarly waived.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The early Minnesota
lawmakers found plenty of business of the same kind. "Be
it enacted," runs a decree of the assembly in 1849, "that
the marriage heretofore existing between Catherine Hathaway
and her husband, Isaac Hathaway, ... is hereby
dissolved; and the said parties are restored to all the rights
and privileges of unmarried persons."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Another example
seems to show that a "pale-face" cannot always live happily
with a "dusky mate." It is solemnly declared "that Louis
Laramie is hereby divorced from Wa-kan-ye-ke-win, his
wife, as fully and effectually, as if the legal ceremony of
marriage and its rites had never been solemnized."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Similar
decrees appear in the statute-book until in 1856 constitutional
authority finally put a stop to legislative interference.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>During the first six years of territorial life many special
divorce decrees may be found in the Nebraska laws; and they
are invariably expressed in the curt and summary style
peculiar to such legislation throughout the country, no reference
usually being made to causes or to alimony.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
same time Kansas was having a similar experience. One
divorce petition was granted by the assembly in 1857, three
in 1858, eight in 1859, while in 1860 the number suddenly
rose to forty-three; for this was the "last chance" before
the constitutional prohibition of 1859 went into effect.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Previous to 1847 Iowa was still more indulgent. Year after
year appeals were made to the assembly for relief. Sometimes
the intention appears to be to deny the defendant the
privilege of further wedlock; as in 1840, when a decree was
granted to dissolve the marriage contract, "so far as relates
to the said Harriet Williams," who is allowed to change her
name. Sometimes a partial divorce is sanctioned, as when
the marital bond between John Philips and Nancy his wife
was "so far dissolved as to permit the said parties to live
separate and apart from each other." In this case the
woman was given power to sue and be sued, and was allowed
to retain the children. In 1841-42 eleven more legislative
decrees were granted. The next year saw nineteen petitions
combined in one bill, which was passed over the governor's
veto by a two-thirds vote. The last examples occur
in 1846, the year when Iowa was admitted to the Union as
a state, and when the usual constitutional interdict appears.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The practice existed also in Idaho,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Montana,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> and
Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> On the Pacific coast, however, Washington is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
chief offender. Beginning with three cases in 1858 and
one in 1859, the number mounts to fifteen in 1860, seventeen
in 1861, fifteen in 1862, and sixteen in 1863; while
after this date the session laws are silent on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>In some of the old middle states the custom was particularly
tenacious. Of it the New York laws show scarcely a trace;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
and in those of New Jersey no evidence at all has been discovered.
The case is very different in Pennsylvania. Although
in 1785 the courts were empowered to grant full or
partial divorce for the causes specified, the habit of resorting
to the assembly, especially when the offense complained of
was not a cause recognized by the statute, survived from the
provincial era. Thus in 1805 Rebecca Adkinson was released
from her spouse Thomas, who for crimes committed
had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment. "Whereas
it appears that the conduct of the said Thomas, from the
month of May, 1803, to the present time, has been one continued
scene of vice, evincing a total dereliction of morality,
and an entire neglect of his wife and tender infant," therefore,
since the law has not provided for such emergency, the
assembly sets Rebecca absolutely free from the wedding
bond.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> During the next year a case of somewhat unusual
character arose. From the preamble to the bill it appears
that as early as 1777 Jacob Sell and Eve, his wife, had divorced
themselves by mutual consent, the woman by a
written instrument relinquishing all her rights under the
marriage. Thereafter, the man considering himself entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
free from former obligations, took unto himself another wife,
"by whom he now has living six children." Through "hard
labor and honest industry" a considerable property was in
due course acquired, some of which Sell had transferred.
To this under the existing laws he could not give perfect
title because of a claim to dower which "the aforesaid Eve
may be supposed to possess." For this reason, and because
he had grown old and was in a "delicate state of health,"
the assembly granted his petition for an absolute dissolution
of the first marriage.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> From this time onward many divorce
decrees may be found in the session laws; and not until the
adoption of the constitution of 1874 was the practice entirely
abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>It was in Delaware, however, that legislative divorce died
the hardest death. By the act of 1832 the superior court
was given "sole cognizance of granting divorces" for cruelty,
abandonment, and some other causes; and in 1852 it was
enacted that no "petition for a divorce shall be received or
acted on by the general assembly for any cause cognizable"
by that court, "nor without proof of one month's public notice
of the intention to prefer such petition, by advertisements
in a newspaper published within the county of the
petitioner's residence, if there be one," or, if not, then in
some other newspaper in the state.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Although this declaration
of the assembly restricting its jurisdiction to cases not
provided for by law was subsequently more than once repeated,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
there was still a wide range for interference, even if the will
of one legislature could bind that of another. The number
of petitions granted waxed apace. In 1887 it was forty-two;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in 1889, sixty-three; and two years later, forty-eight.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In
the meantime a remedy was sought through appeal to constitutional
interdict. Once the effort was almost successful.
By an act of April 20, 1893, the assembly proposed an amendment
to the constitution giving the supreme court exclusive
jurisdiction in divorce suits, but only "for the causes and upon
the conditions prescribed by the legislature.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> This amendment
failed of adoption; but its purpose was soon secured in
the new constitution of 1897, which declares that "no divorce
shall be granted, nor alimony allowed, except by the
judgment of a court, as shall be prescribed by general and
uniform law."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p><i>b</i>) <i>Judicial divorce: jurisdiction, kinds, and causes.</i>&mdash;Regarding
the causes of divorce the history of the middle
and western states reveals little that is peculiar as compared
with that of the southern or eastern group. On the whole,
a medial course has been pursued. There is nothing very
radical or very conservative. The statutes of these commonwealths
are entitled to be looked upon as constituting the
average American type.</p>

<p>The policy of New York has, indeed, seemed to be exceptional.
Throughout the century absolute divorce has been
allowed only on the scriptural ground. In 1787&mdash;for the
first time since New Netherland came under English rule&mdash;a
general divorce law was enacted. The preamble hints at
the recent practice of special legislation. "Whereas," we
are told, "the Laws at present in being within this state, respecting
Adultery, are very defective, and Applications have,
in Consequence, been made to the Legislature, praying their
Interposition;" and since "it is thought more advisable ...
to make some general Provision in such Cases, than to
afford relief to Individuals, upon their partial representations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
without a just and Constitutional Trial of the Facts;"
therefore for the offense named, when the persons are inhabitants
of the state, a "Petition or Bill" may be presented to
the chancellor. The latter is empowered to direct the trial
of the case by a "special or common jury" before either the
supreme or any circuit court; and in case of conviction may
"pronounce the marriage between the said parties to be dissolved,
and both of them freed" from its obligations. The
guilty defendant is forbidden to "remarry any person whatsoever;"
while the innocent plaintiff is fully authorized to
"make and complete another marriage, in like manner as if
the party convicted was actually dead." The divorce is not
to affect the legitimacy of the children, and the chancellor
is required to make proper orders for their care and maintenance
and for the wife's alimony.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>No further legislation on the subject appears until 1813,
when some important changes in the law were made. Now
a petition for divorce, on the same grounds, may be brought
only when the persons concerned were inhabitants of the
state at the time the offense was committed; or when the
marriage was solemnized or took place in the state, and the
person injured was an actual resident of the state at the time
of the offense and at the time of exhibiting the bill. The
facts are to be tried by a "special or foreign" jury at some
circuit court or sittings, to be held by a justice of the supreme
court; and the person convicted is prohibited from further
marriage only during the lifetime of the other spouse. But
the most important innovation made by this act is the provision
for partial divorce in favor of the wife. Under the
same conditions as to residence, the court of chancery is
empowered to grant a <i>feme covert</i> a decree of "separation
from bed and board forever thereafter, or for a limited time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as shall seem just and reasonable," when the husband has
been guilty (1) of cruel and inhuman treatment; or (2) of such
conduct "as may render it unsafe and improper for her to
cohabit with him, and be under his dominion and control;"
or (3) when he has abandoned her and neglected or refused
to provide for her support. In all such cases, if the defendant
prove the ill conduct of the complainant as a justification,
he may be "dismissed with or without costs in the discretion
of the court." On the other hand, whether a separation be
decreed or not, the court is authorized "to make such orders
and decree for the suitable support and maintenance" of the
wife and children by the husband or out of his property, as
the chancellor shall deem just.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Revised Statutes</i> of 1827-28 make careful provision
for the annulment of voidable marriages; and by the same
enactment the divorce law is recast. Through sentence of
nullity the chancellor may declare void a marriage for the
following causes existing at the time of the contract: when
(1) either husband or wife was below the age of consent; or
(2) had a spouse living under a marriage still in force; or
(3) was an idiot or lunatic; or (4) when consent of either
was obtained by force or fraud; or (5) when either was
physically incompetent to enter the matrimonial state. All
these grounds of nullity, with one slight change and some
modification of the conditions on which suit may be brought,
are sanctioned by the present code.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Divorce from the bond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of wedlock according to the revision of 1827-28 may be
granted on the same conditions regarding residence as those
prescribed in 1813, except that it allows the injured person,
if an actual inhabitant at the time of exhibiting the bill, to
bring suit whenever the offense complained of has been committed
in the state. As in 1803, the guilty defendant is forbidden
to remarry until after the death of the complainant.
The three grounds of separation from bed and board in favor
of the wife allowed in that year remain unaltered, save that
under the second head the phrase referring to her being
under the husband's "dominion and control" is omitted;
and now, when the marriage takes place out of the state, the
parties must have "become and remained inhabitants" of it
for at least one year, and in order to warrant a decree the
woman must be an actual resident thereof at the time of
bringing complaint.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Under the existing law of New York, for adultery, absolute
divorce may be granted to either the husband or wife (1) when
both were residents of the state at the time of the offense;
(2) when the marriage took place within the state; (3) when
the plaintiff was a resident of the state when the offense was
committed, and so remains at the commencement of the suit;
(4) where the offense was committed in the state and the
person injured is a resident thereof when the action is
brought. In the first instance the judgment is "interlocutory;"

action." At present suit for partial divorce may be brought
by either spouse, and not by the wife only, as under the
earlier laws. The grounds allowed are (1) cruel and inhuman
treatment; (2) conduct rendering it unsafe and improper for
the plaintiff to cohabit with the defendant; (3) abandonment;
(4) where the wife is plaintiff, the neglect or refusal
of the husband to provide for her.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> When the marriage

<p>New Jersey, whose early history ran so closely parallel
to that of New York, has during the century pursued a policy
regarding divorce more liberal than that of the neighboring
commonwealth. As so often happens, the act of 1794 confuses
the grounds of annulment with those of divorce proper.
The court of chancery is authorized to decree "divorces from
the bond of matrimony" (1) when the husband and wife are
within the prohibited degrees of kinship; (2) for adultery;
(3) for "wilful, continued, and obstinate desertion for the
term of seven years;" or (4) when either person had a lawful
spouse living at the time of the later marriage, although
the statute inconsistently declares such unions "invalid
from the beginning" and "absolutely void." This last-named
provision is still in force.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> By the law of 1794,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
moreover, separation from bed and board is sanctioned for
"extreme cruelty" in either spouse.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>A new statute appears in 1820. The conditions as to
residence are now defined; the court of chancery may grant
absolute dissolution of wedlock for the same causes as in
1794; and separation from bed and board is still permitted
for extreme cruelty, but now it may be decreed, "forever,
or for a limited time."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> In the revision of the divorce laws
approved April 15, 1846, the term of wilful and continued
desertion is reduced to five years;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> in 1857 two years more
are lopped off;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and finally a statute of 1890 declares a
period of two years' such desertion sufficient to constitute a
ground of full divorce.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, by the present law of New Jersey dissolution
of wedlock may be decreed by the court of chancery (1)
when the marriage is bigamous; (2) when it is within the
forbidden degrees of kinship;<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> (3) for adultery; (4) for
"wilful, continued, and obstinate desertion during the term
of two years;" and (5) when at the time of the marriage
either spouse was "physically and incurably impotent," in
which case the contract is declared "invalid from the beginning
and absolutely void."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> But it is important to observe
that in certain cases the term of desertion is subject to a
peculiar statutory definition. It is declared that "wilful
and obstinate desertion shall be ... construed as 'continued'
... notwithstanding that after such desertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
has ... begun, the deserting party has ... been imprisoned
in this or any other state or country upon conviction
by due process of law for a crime, misdemeanor or
offence, not political," anywhere committed; provided, however,
that such desertion has continued without interruption
a sufficient length of time after discharge from prison to
make up when added to the term of desertion prior to the
confinement the full term of three [two] years.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Since 1891
three causes of separation from bed and board have been
allowed. For desertion, adultery, or extreme cruelty, in
either spouse, the court of chancery may now decree such
partial divorce "forever thereafter, or in the case of extreme
cruelty, for a limited time, as shall seem just and reasonable;"
but in every case except for extreme cruelty the
petitioner "shall prove that he or she has conscientious
scruples against applying for a divorce from the bond of
matrimony."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>The framers of the Pennsylvania statute of 1785 saw fit
to indulge in an apologetic preamble. "Whereas," we are
assured, "it is the design of marriage, and the wish of the
parties entering into that state, that it should continue during
their joint lives, yet where the one party is under natural
or legal incapacities of faithfully discharging the matrimonial
vow, or is guilty of acts and deeds inconsistent with the
nature thereof, the laws of every well-regulated society ought
to give relief to the innocent and injured person;" therefore
it is enacted that the justices of the supreme court may grant
divorce, "not only from bed and board, but also from matrimony,"(1)
when either person at the time of the contract
was and still is physically incompetent; (2) has knowingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
entered into a bigamous marriage; (3) has committed adultery;
or (4) has been guilty of "wilful and malicious desertion,
without a reasonable cause," for the space of four years.
The court is empowered to grant a divorce from bed and
board, but not from the bond of wedlock, "if any husband
shall, maliciously, either (1) abandon his family, or (2) turn
his wife out of doors, or (3) by cruel and barbarous treatment
endanger her life, or (4) offer such indignities to her
person, as to render her condition intolerable, or life burdensome,
and thereby force her to withdraw from his house
and family." In these cases the wife is allowed "such alimony
as her husband's circumstances will admit of so as the
same do not exceed the third part of the annual profits or
income of his estate, or of his occupation or labour," or the
court may decree "but one of them" as justice may require.
She shall continue to enjoy this alimony "until a reconciliation
shall take place, or until the husband shall by his petition
or libel, offer to receive or cohabit with her again, and
to use her as a good husband ought to do." Then the court
is authorized either to suspend the decree; or, if the wife
refuse "to return and cohabit under the protection of the
court," it may discharge and annul the same. But if he
fail to make good his offers and engagement, the "former
sentence and decree may be revived and enforced;" and the
arrears of alimony may be ordered paid.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>By the first statute of the period, it thus appears, a liberal
divorce policy was adopted by Pennsylvania, and besides, it
should be remembered, the courts were not the only source
of relief. For many years, as already seen, the assembly
exercised jurisdiction in divorce matters. After 1785 the
first step in the practical relaxation of the law was taken in
1804, when jurisdiction, hitherto vested exclusively in the
supreme court, was extended to the county courts of common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pleas, where it still remains.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Since that date the progress
of legislation has been rapid enough. Under the existing
law, as the result of a century's growth, not less than eleven
grounds of complete divorce are recognized. By the statute
of 1815, repealing the law of 1785, the four causes sanctioned
by the latter are re-enacted, the term of "malicious
desertion and absence from the habitation of the other"&mdash;as
the clause is now phrased&mdash;being reduced to two
years; and it is further provided that full dissolution of
marriage may be decreed (5) when any husband, by cruel
and barbarous treatment, shall have endangered the life of
his wife; or (6) offered such indignities to her person as to
render her condition intolerable and life burdensome, thereby
forcing her to withdraw from his house and family.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Marriage
within the forbidden degrees of affinity or consanguinity
(7) was made a ground in the same year;<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> lunacy of the
wife (8) came next in 1843;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and in 1854 divorce was sanctioned
(9) when the alleged marriage was procured by
fraud, force, or coercion, and has not been later confirmed
by the acts of the person injured; (10) when the wife, by
cruel and barbarous treatment, has rendered the condition
of her husband intolerable or life burdensome; or (11) when
either spouse has been convicted for felony with imprisonment
for more than two years.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> These eleven causes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
still in force, although in 1903 a new law regarding the
crimes of either spouse to constitute a cause was adopted.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the century has produced but one
change in the special grounds of partial divorce. Petitions
for separation from bed and board are still allowed only in
favor of the wife. The four causes sanctioned in 1785,
re-enacted in 1815 and 1817, are yet in force;<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> while, since
1862, adultery on the part of the husband is admitted as a
fifth ground of complaint.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>An important innovation appears in 1893. A new group
of discretionary causes is then created. The courts are
empowered to grant the wife a divorce, either from bed and
board or from the bond of wedlock, on four several grounds.
Three of these are identical with the third, fourth, and fifth
causes of partial divorce just enumerated. In addition, two
years' "wilful and malicious desertion" by the husband is
admitted. These same four causes are declared valid "where
it shall be shown to the court by any wife that she was
formerly a citizen of this commonwealth, and that having
intermarried with a citizen of any other state or any foreign
country, she has been compelled to abandon the habitation
and domicile of her husband" in such place, thereby being
"forced to return to this commonwealth in which she had
her former domicile." In any such case, if personal service
by subpœna cannot be made upon the husband by reason of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
his non-residence, the court before entering a decree shall
require proof that, in addition to the publication required by
law, actual or constructive notice of the proceedings has been
given him, either "by personal service or by registered
letter to his last known place of residence, and that a reasonable
time has thereby been afforded to him to appear" and
make defense. The wife, however, is only entitled to the
benefits of this act when she has been a citizen and resident
of the state for one year previous to bringing suit.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>It must further be observed, in connection with the
present laws of Pennsylvania regarding absolute divorce,
that the principle of the colonial statute touching cases of
long absence has unfortunately been perpetuated. The
snare is still set for the feet of the unwary. "If any husband
or wife, upon false rumor, in appearance well founded,
of the death of the other (when such other has been absent
for the space of two whole years), hath married ... again,
he or she shall not be liable to the pains of adultery;" but on
return the person remaining unmarried may elect either to
have the former spouse restored or to have the former contract
dissolved, leaving the second marriage undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>By the Delaware statute of February 3, 1832, the superior
court is authorized to grant absolute divorce, or, in its
discretion, partial divorce or merely alimony, where either
spouse (1) had a lawful husband or wife living at the time
of the marriage; (2) has been wilfully absent from the other
for three years with the intention of abandonment; (3) has
committed adultery; or (4) extreme cruelty; or (5) where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the male was actually impotent when the marriage took place.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
Just twenty years later an entirely new grouping of causes
and kinds of separation was introduced. The superior court
is empowered to grant a full divorce (1) for adultery of the
wife; and (2) for impotency of either person at the time of
marriage; while separation from bed and board is allowed
(1) for adultery of the husband; (2) for extreme cruelty; or
(3) for wilful absence of either for three years with intent to
abandon. At the same time a distinction was made between
divorce and annulment. The court is authorized to declare
null and void a marriage (1) within the prohibited degrees
of affinity or consanguinity; (2) between a white person and
a negro or mulatto; (3) where either person was insane; or
(4) had a spouse living at the time of the contract.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> At
present the annulment of voidable contracts is still governed
by the enactment of 1852.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>In 1859 a revised scheme was substituted. Absolute
divorce is authorized on the same two grounds as in 1852,
the unjust discrimination regarding the husband's infidelity
being still maintained. On the other hand, "a divorce from
the bond of matrimony, or from bed and board, at the discretion
of the court," may now be decreed for (1) adultery of
the husband; (2) extreme cruelty; (3) procurement of the
marriage by force or fraud; (4) want of legal age&mdash;sixteen
for males and fourteen for females&mdash;if after that age the
marriage has not been voluntarily ratified; (5) wilful abandonment
for three years; (6) conviction in any place, before
or after marriage, of a crime deemed felony by the laws of
the state; (7) habitual gross drunkenness for three years,
contracted after marriage; or (8) three years' wilful neglect
by the husband to provide his wife with the common necessaries
of life.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>By the present law of Delaware, which has existed since
1873, the superior court may decree absolute divorce for (1)
adultery in either spouse; (2) desertion for three years; (3)
habitual drunkenness; (4) impotency at the time of marriage;
(5) extreme cruelty; or (6) conviction of felony, as in 1859.
The discretionary grounds on which the court may grant
either full or limited divorce are now reduced to two, these
in substance being nearly identical with the fourth and
eighth causes sanctioned by the statute of 1859.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The history of judicial divorce in the West begins with
the statute adopted for the Northwest Territory in 1795.
Jurisdiction is vested in the general court and the circuit
courts, which are empowered to grant absolute divorce (1)
for adultery; (2) impotency; (3) where either person had a
husband or wife alive at the time of the second marriage; or
to grant partial divorce for extreme cruelty in either spouse.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
This law was repealed in 1804 by an act of the legislature of
Ohio&mdash;that portion of the Northwest Territory having been
made a state in 1802&mdash;giving the supreme court sole cognizance
of divorce suits. By it no provision for partial divorce
is made; but full dissolution of marriage is sanctioned (1)
for bigamy, as in 1795; (2) for wilful absence for five years;
(3) for adultery; and (4) for extreme cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> After eighteen
years' trial, the plan of 1804 was in its turn superseded.
Six grounds of absolute divorce were then provided. Of
these four are identical with those just mentioned, except
that the term of wilful absence is reduced to three years.
In addition there are recognized (5) physical incompetence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at the time of the marriage; and (6) sentence with actual
imprisonment for violation of the criminal laws of the state,
provided application be made during the term of confinement.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
Two years later a new plan was adopted. Absolute
divorce was permitted for the six causes allowed in 1822;
and partial divorce, which had not existed by statute for
twenty years, was revived; the courts, on the same six
grounds, being authorized, instead of full dissolution of wedlock,
to decree separation from bed and board, or merely
alimony, according to justice and the circumstances in each
case.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> This provision, however, was short-lived; for in 1833
partial divorce was a second time abolished.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Thus matters stood until 1853, when a measure appeared
by which the law was much relaxed in several important
respects. Jurisdiction, which since 1804 had remained
solely in the supreme tribunal of the state, was now vested
in the several courts of common pleas. In addition to the
six grounds for full divorce already created, four new causes
were recognized. These were (7) fraudulent contract; (8)
gross neglect of duty; (9) habitual drunkenness for three
years; and (10) a decree of divorce in another state "by virtue
of which the party who shall have obtained such decree
shall have been released from the obligations of the marriage
contract, while the same remains binding upon the other."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>These ten causes of absolute divorce are still sanctioned
by Ohio law. No provision is made for limited divorce; but
there is an "action for alimony, which is in effect a limited
divorce, and which may be brought by the wife for any of
the following causes," also sanctioned by the act of 1853:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
(1) adultery; (2) any gross neglect of duty; (3) abandonment
without good cause; (4) separation in consequence of the
husband's ill-treatment, whether the wife is maintained by
him or not; (5) habitual drunkenness; and (6) sentence to
imprisonment in a penitentiary, if application be made while
the husband is so confined.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Indiana, in 1816, is the next portion of the Northwest
Territory to be admitted to the Union. Two years after the
attainment of statehood her legislature passed the first
divorce statute, granting jurisdiction to the circuit courts.
By the enactment full divorce in favor of either spouse when
aggrieved is allowed for (1) adultery; (2) matrimonial
incapacity; (3) bigamous contract; (4) two years' absence
with intent to abandon; (5) desertion and living in adultery;
(6) conviction for felony; and (7) in favor of the wife when
the husband's treatment of her is extremely barbarous and
inhuman.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> In 1824 an "omnibus" clause was introduced, a
full divorce being then allowed on petition of the injured
person (8) "in all cases where the court in its discretion"
shall deem the same "just and reasonable."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> These grounds
are all sanctioned by the act of 1831.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Still another cause
was admitted in 1836. The circuit courts are empowered to
grant the wife absolute divorce (9) when the husband for
two years has been a habitual drunkard, and has failed for
"any unreasonable length of time to make provision for his
family." By the same act, moreover, a marriage may be
dissolved "in all cases where the parties have been guilty of
murder, manslaughter, burglary, robbery, grand or petty
larceny, forgery, counterfeiting, arson, bribery, perjury, or
any other crime" the penalty for which on conviction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
"imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But,
apparently, this is meant to be a restatement of the sixth
cause above given.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Only two years elapsed before a new general statute was
adopted, authorizing full divorce on eight grounds. Six of
these correspond to the first, second, sixth, seventh, eighth,
and ninth causes already sanctioned. Bigamous marriage
and desertion with adultery no longer appear as causes;
while the fourth ground, as above enumerated, is so modified
as to require a separate statement for the husband and wife
respectively. The husband (7) is allowed a full divorce for
two years' absence of the wife with intent to abandon; and
the wife is granted the same relief (8) for like absence of
the husband, "and also for any other cause or causes"&mdash;a
most singular legislative freak.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In 1843 this vicious clause
was dropped. Abandonment for two years is now made a
cause of divorce in favor of either person, thus reducing the
number of legal grounds to seven. At the same time, in
modification of a cause already existing, the wife is allowed
a petition on account of "cruel and inhuman treatment" by
the husband, "or when his conduct towards her has been
such as may render it unsafe and improper for her to live
with him." The other five causes sanctioned by the statute
of 1838 are re-enacted without change.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> A relaxation of the
law takes place in 1849. One year's abandonment is
declared sufficient to constitute a cause; but in such case
the court is especially empowered, in its discretion, to grant
a divorce, waiving all objections in regard to time of separation,
if it deems a reconciliation "hopeless."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>A pause of three years next ensues before the lawmaker
resumes his tinkering with the causes of divorce. The act
of 1852 admits the seven general grounds, as these had
existed since the change in 1849; but with two important
modifications. For now "habitual drunkenness," without
reference to the term during which it has existed, and cruel
treatment, each on the part of either husband or wife, are
constituted reasons for dissolving the marriage bond. By
the same law a divorce for adultery is denied when there
has been (1) connivance; (2) voluntary cohabitation after
knowledge of the offense; (3) neglect to petition within
two years; or (4) when the petitioner is guilty of the same
crime.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Seven years later the time of abandonment, to constitute
a cause, was reduced to one year, the court being
thus deprived of its discretionary power to grant a divorce
for desertion during a shorter period.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Finally the long series of enactments defining the grounds
of absolute divorces came to a halt in 1873, when the law of
Indiana in this regard took its present form. The superior
and circuit courts, on petition of either spouse, are granted
jurisdiction. Three very important and beneficial amendments,
producing a marked decrease in the number of
divorces annually granted, are now made. The term of
abandonment is increased from one year to two years;
"failure of the husband to make reasonable provision for
his family" is changed to such failure for a "period of two
years;" and, most significant of all, the omnibus clause,
existing since 1824 and rephrased in 1838, providing that
divorces may be granted "for any other cause" which the
court shall deem "reasonable and proper," is stricken out.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
As a result, the marriage tie may now be dissolved for (1)
adultery; (2) impotence existing at the time of the marriage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
(3) abandonment for two years; (4) cruel and inhuman
treatment; (5) habitual drunkenness; (6) failure of the
husband to make reasonable provision for his family for two
years; (7) the conviction of either person, in any country,
subsequent to the marriage, of an infamous crime. Until
very recently limited divorce was not recognized in Indiana;
but a married woman might bring action for the support of
herself and infant children in the following cases, being
analogous to those sanctioned by the Ohio law: (1) when
the husband shall have deserted his wife, or wife and children,
without leaving sufficient provision for support; (2)
when he shall have been convicted of felony and imprisoned
in the state prison, not leaving his wife, or wife and children,
the same provision; (3) when he is a habitual drunkard
and by reason thereof becomes incapacitated or neglects to
provide for his family; or (4) when he renounces the marriage
covenant, or refuses to live with his wife in the conjugal
relation, by joining himself to a sect or denomination
the rules and doctrines of which require such renunciation
or forbid a man and woman to dwell and cohabit together
in the conjugal relation according to the true intent and
meaning of the institution of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> A statute of 1903
authorizes separation from bed and board "for a limited
time" in case of (1) adultery; (2) "desertion, or where the
wife is plaintiff, neglect or refusal to suitably provide for
her, covering a period of six months;" (3) habitual cruelty
of one party, "or such constant strifes of both parties as
render their living together intolerable;" (4) habitual
drunkenness, "or the confirmed and excessive use of morphine,
cocaine, or any other drug;" (5) gross and wanton
neglect of conjugal duty for six months.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1818, closely following Indiana, Illinois was carved
from the bountiful region northwest of the Ohio River.
After a year's delay, a divorce law was enacted in 1819;
and this, as amended in 1825, authorizes both kinds of
separation. Full dissolution of wedlock may be granted for
(1) physical incapacity at the time of solemnization; (2)
adultery; (3) two years' voluntary and continued absence.
Partial divorce is likewise sanctioned for (1) extreme and
repeated cruelty in either spouse: or (2) constant and
habitual intemperance in either for two years. "But in the
latter case it shall be incumbent on the complaining party
to show that he or she had performed all the duties of a
faithful and affectionate husband or wife."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>The act of 1827 is silent as to limited divorce, which has
not since been recognized in Illinois. Full divorce may
now be granted by the circuit courts, sitting as courts of
equity, when either person (1) was at the time of the marriage
and still is naturally impotent; (2) had a husband or
wife living at the time of the marriage; (3) has since been
guilty of adultery; or (4) wilful desertion for two years; or
(5) extreme and repeated cruelty; or (6) habitual drunkenness
for two years.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> A step backward was taken in 1832
through the adoption of a kind of omnibus clause. By proceedings
in chancery full dissolution of marriage is authorized
(7) for all causes of divorce not provided for by any law
of the state.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Next, after an interval of thirteen years, on
the petition of the aggrieved, comes (8) conviction for felony
or other infamous crime.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> This is followed after the lapse
of thirty years more by the sanction (9) of absolute divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
when either person "has attempted the life of the other by
poison or other means showing malice."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The tale of causes allowed by the present law of Illinois
is thus complete. Separation from bed and board is not
provided for by statute. In general, chancery process is
required. The circuit courts of the respective counties and
the superior court of Cook county (Chicago) are clothed
with jurisdiction in divorce controversies.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Michigan became a separate territory in 1805, and seven
years thereafter the supreme court was granted jurisdiction
in both kinds of divorce.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> By the act of 1819 marriage may
be dissolved for adultery in either spouse, when the husband
and wife are inhabitants of the territory, or when the marriage
was solemnized therein; as also when the injured person
was an actual resident of the territory at the time of the
offense, and so remains when the bill is filed. When guilty,
the wife forfeits her right of dower. On the other hand, the
court may grant her a divorce <i>a mensa</i>, forever or for a
limited time, (1) for "cruel and inhuman treatment;" (2)
for such conduct on the part of the husband "as may render
it unsafe and improper for her to cohabit with him and be
under his dominion and control;" or (3) when "he has
abandoned her and refuses or neglects to provide" for her
support.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>A different plan appears in 1832. A divorce from the
bond of wedlock is now permitted (1) for impotency, and (2)
for adultery. Furthermore, the court, in its discretion, is
empowered to grant either person a full or a partial divorce
(1) for extreme cruelty, or (2) for five years' wilful desertion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
By this act jurisdiction is vested in the supreme
court and either of the circuit courts of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> A
statute of the next year retains all these provisions of 1832,
except that the term of wilful desertion, to constitute a discretionary
ground, is reduced to three years.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Five years
later, after Michigan became a state, a divorce is made
unnecessary when a marriage is void or when the persons
contracting it are below the age of consent. At the same
time the grounds of separation are reconsidered. Absolute
divorce is now authorized (1) for adultery; (2) for impotence;
(3) for five years' desertion; (4) for sentence to imprisonment
at hard labor for three years or more; and either a
full or a partial divorce, on the petition of either spouse, (1)
for extreme cruelty; (2) for three years' "utter desertion;"
or (3) on application of the wife, when the husband, being
of sufficient ability to provide a suitable maintenance for
her, "shall grossly or wantonly and cruelly refuse or neglect
to do so."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> In 1844 extreme cruelty, "whether practiced by
using personal violence, or by any other means," was substituted
for the corresponding clause in the act of 1838.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
Next, in 1846 and 1847 came swift changes in the law of
desertion, but only in their turn to be swept away in 1848.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
So in 1851 we reach an act by which the grounds of divorce
in Michigan have been determined for half a century.</p>

<p>By the existing law, as then enacted, on application of
the aggrieved, a full divorce may be decreed by the court
of chancery, or by the circuit court of the county where the
parties or one of them resides, for (1) adultery; (2) physical
incompetency; (3) sentence to imprisonment for three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
or more, no pardon to affect the status of the divorced persons;
(4) two years' desertion; (5) when the husband or wife
shall have become a habitual drunkard; "and (6) the circuit
courts may, in their discretion, upon application as in other
cases, divorce from the bonds of matrimony any party who
is a resident of this state, and whose husband or wife shall
have obtained a divorce in any other state." The same tribunals
are authorized, in their discretion, to grant either a
limited or a full divorce in favor of the aggrieved for (1)
extreme cruelty, "whether practiced by using personal
violence, or by any other means;" (2) utter desertion for two
years; or (3) on complaint of the wife for the husband's
neglect to provide, as by the law of 1838.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Wisconsin, the remaining<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> portion of the region originally
governed by the ordinance of 1787, was erected into
a separate territory in 1836. Its divorce legislation, which
in its general outline is similar to that of Michigan, began
in 1838-39, when the district court of each county was
given jurisdiction in both kinds of separation. The causes
of absolute divorce then recognized are (1) impotence; (2)
adultery. Those of partial divorces are (1) extreme cruelty;
(2) two years' wilful desertion; (3) habitual drunkenness;
(4) abandonment of the wife by the husband, or "his refusal
or neglect to provide for her."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>In 1849, the year following the attainment of statehood,
was adopted a new statute by which the foundation of the
present system was laid. By it, as under the present law, a
marriage is declared absolutely dissolved without any decree
of divorce or legal process whenever either spouse is sentenced
to imprisonment for life; and a pardon is not to
effect a restoration of conjugal rights. The circuit courts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
are granted jurisdiction. Both full and partial divorce are
provided for. Absolute divorce is allowed for (1) adultery;
(2) impotence; (3) sentence of either spouse to imprisonment
for a period of three years or more, no pardon working
a restoration of conjugal rights; (4) wilful desertion
for one year next preceding the commencement of the
action; (5) when the treatment of the wife by the husband
has been "cruel and inhuman, whether practiced by using
personal violence, or by any other means," or "when the
wife shall be guilty of like cruelty to her husband or shall
be given to intoxication;" (6) when the husband or wife
shall have been a habitual drunkard for the space of one
year immediately preceding the filing of the bill. To these
grounds was added as a cause in 1866: (7) voluntarily living
entirely separate for the five years next preceding the
commencement of the action.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> So the law of absolute divorce
remains at the present time, all attempts to make insanity a
permanent ground having thus far failed.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The history of partial divorce in Wisconsin is soon told.
The provisions of the act of 1849 are still in force. The
causes of separation from bed and board, forever or for
a limited time, there recognized are (1) the fourth, fifth,
and sixth grounds of full divorce above specified; (2) extreme
cruelty of either spouse; (3) on complaint of the wife
when the husband, being of sufficient ability, shall refuse
or neglect to provide for her; or (4) when his conduct
toward her is such as may render it unsafe and improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for her to live with him. It is expressly declared that a
divorce from the bond of matrimony may be decreed for
either of the three causes last named, "whenever, in the
opinion of the court, the circumstances of the case are such
that it will be discreet and proper to do so." From the
somewhat awkward arrangement of its provisions, therefore,
the general effect of this statute appears to be that a full
divorce <i>may</i> be granted for any ground recognized by it,
provided the court deems it prudent to exercise its discretionary
authority. Furthermore, it must be noted that by
the existing law, just as in 1849, the circuit court is empowered
to allow separate maintenance when a partial divorce is
denied.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>We may next pass to the long list of new states in the
West and Northwest whose generous boundaries spread over
the Mississippi valley, the vast regions of the Rocky Mountains,
and the Pacific slope. The course of legislation in
Minnesota has run closely parallel to that of Wisconsin,
though it is divergent in some important details. In 1851,
seven years before the admission of that state to the Union,
a statute logically declared bigamous marriages and those
within the forbidden degrees, if solemnized in the territory,
void without a decree. At the same time, as causes of absolute
divorce in favor of the aggrieved were sanctioned (1)
adultery; (2) impotency; (3) sentence to imprisonment in
the penitentiary after the marriage, no subsequent pardon
effecting a restoration of conjugal rights; (4) wilful desertion
for one year next preceding the commencement of the
suit; (5) cruel and inhuman treatment, whether practiced
by using personal violence or by any other means; (6)
habitual drunkenness for one year immediately preceding
the filing of the complaint. By this act no provision is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
made for partial divorce.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The term of wilful desertion
was increased from one year to three years in 1866;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> but
in 1895 the shorter period was restored, so that under
the existing law the six grounds of absolute divorce as
sanctioned in 1851 are recognized, except that "cruel and
inhuman treatment" is constituted a cause, the original
explanatory clause being omitted.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> On the other hand,
limited divorce is now provided for. Since 1876, on complaint
of a married woman, separation from bed and board
is authorized (1) for cruel and inhuman treatment by the
husband; (2) for such conduct on his part as may render it
unsafe and improper for her to cohabit with him; or (3) for
abandonment and refusal or neglect by him to provide for
her. The district court of the county where the persons or
one of them resides is now vested with jurisdiction in all
actions for divorce or for the annulment of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>One of the worst and most characteristic features of American
state legislation is seen in the session laws of Iowa,
where the statute-maker is perennially engaged in adopting,
changing, abrogating, or re-enacting plans of divorce and
alimony. The first step was taken in 1838, when the district
court of the county where the persons or one of them
resides was given jurisdiction on the petition of the aggrieved.
The grounds of absolute divorce then allowed are (1) impotence;
and (2) adultery. Those of divorce <i>a mensa</i> or of
divorce from the bond of wedlock, in the discretion of the
court, are (1) extreme cruelty; or (2) wilful desertion for
one year.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> This law was repealed and a new one adopted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the next year. Nothing is now said of separation from bed
and board; but a full divorce may be had by the injured
spouse for (1) impotency; (2) bigamous marriage; (3) adultery;
(4) one year's desertion; (5) felony; (6) habitual
drunkenness; (7) cruel treatment; (8) indignities.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Three
years later this statute in turn gave place to another by
which the same causes are sanctioned, except, under the
sixth head, it is provided that "said habitual drunkenness
shall be contracted after marriage."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> In 1846, however,
this proviso was dropped; and at the same time an "omnibus"
clause was sanctioned. A full divorce may now be
granted (9) "when it shall be made fully apparent to the
satisfaction of the court, that the parties cannot live in peace
and happiness together, and that their welfare requires a
separation."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The eighth ground was dropped in 1851,
and at the same time it was again specified under the sixth
head that drunkenness shall have become habitual after
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Thus matters stood until 1855, when the worthy legislators
managed to put the law in a curiously awkward shape.
It was then decreed that "hereafter no divorce otherwise
than from bed and board shall be granted except" (1) where
either spouse shall commit adultery; (2) be convicted of
felony; (3) was impotent at the time of the marriage; or (4)
wilfully deserts the other for the space of three years. "In
all other enumerated causes heretofore deemed sufficient"&mdash;continues
the statute&mdash;"no divorce otherwise than a divorce
from bed and board shall be granted."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> This scheme was
short-lived. An act of 1858 revives the law as it stood in
1851, except that the term of wilful desertion was extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to two years and the omnibus clause was omitted, thus leaving
seven grounds of petition in force.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>The present law of Iowa governing the causes of divorce
took its rise in the code of 1873. The district court in the
county where the plaintiff or defendant resides still has jurisdiction.
Limited divorce is not recognized, but "it appears
that courts of equity will grant alimony without divorce to
a wife where she is separated from her husband because of
his misconduct, though no express statutory provision is
found authorizing such proceeding."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> A full divorce may
be decreed against the husband (1) when he has committed
adultery subsequent to the marriage; (2) when he wilfully
deserts his wife and absents himself without reasonable cause
for the space of two years; (3) when after marriage he is
convicted of felony; or (4) becomes addicted to habitual
drunkenness; or (5) when he is guilty of such inhuman
treatment as to endanger the life of his wife; and against
the wife, for the five causes just enumerated, and also (6)
when at the time of the marriage she was pregnant by a man
other than her husband, unless the husband then had an illegitimate
child or children living and the fact was unknown
to her.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The divorce legislation of Kansas begins in 1855, the
next year after the territory was erected. The grounds on
which the aggrieved may secure a complete dissolution of
the matrimonial bond are (1) impotence continuing from the
time of the marriage; (2) bigamous marriage; (3) adultery;
(4) wilful desertion and absence for two years without
reasonable cause; (5) conviction of felony or infamous crime;
(6) habitual drunkenness for two years; (7) cruel and barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
treatment endangering life; (8) intolerable indignities
offered to the person; (9) vagrancy of the husband.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> In
1859 this law gave place to another, by which the fifth,
eighth, and ninth causes above enumerated were omitted;
the term of wilful absence, under the fourth head, was reduced
to one year; and habitual drunkenness became a
cause, without specification of the time during which it must
have existed.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The very next year this plan was in its turn
superseded. A new act allowed separate alimony without
dissolution of marriage, and sanctioned eleven grounds of
total divorce. The first four of these are identical with the
corresponding numbers in 1855, as modified in 1859. In
addition are approved (5) pregnancy of the wife at the time
of the marriage by a man other than the husband; (6) extreme
cruelty; (7) fraudulent contract; (8) gross neglect of
duty; (9) habitual drunkenness; (10) sentence for crime and
imprisonment therefor in a penitentiary, provided complaint
be filed during the term of confinement; (11) when one person
has secured a divorce in another state or territory, leaving
the obligation binding on the other.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>The eleventh cause just specified was dropped in 1868.
The remaining ten were then re-enacted;<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and these grounds,
without addition or essential change, constitute the law of
Kansas at the present time. In this state there is no separation
from bed and board. But "the wife may obtain alimony
alone from the husband without a divorce ... for
any of the causes for which a divorce may be granted."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

in the district courts;<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and the supreme court has authority

<p>Both kinds of separation are provided for by the Nebraska
law of 1856; and a marriage is then declared to be completely
dissolved without decree in case of conviction and
imprisonment for life. The district court of the county
where the married persons or one of them resides is empowered
to grant absolute divorce on complaint of the aggrieved
for (1) adultery; (2) physical incompetency at the time of
the marriage; (3) sentence to imprisonment for three years
or more, no pardon effecting a restoration of conjugal rights;
(4) two years' wilful abandonment without good cause; (5)
habitual drunkenness. The same tribunal may decree either
a limited or a full divorce for (1) extreme cruelty; or (2) two
years' utter desertion by either spouse; and (3) in favor of
the wife, when the husband, being of sufficient ability, shall
grossly or wantonly and cruelly refuse or neglect to provide
for her.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> No essential change appears in the statutes until
1875, when imprisonment for life was made a sixth ground
of absolute divorce;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and so the law of Nebraska remains at

<p>Separation from bed and board has at no time been
authorized by the laws of Colorado. The district courts
have jurisdiction. Full divorce may now be granted in favor
of the aggrieved on eight grounds; and in this regard there
have been few changes since the first statute of 1861. The
present causes are (1) impotence continuing from the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the marriage or originating thereafter in consequence of
immoral or criminal conduct; (2) bigamous contract; (3)
adultery; (4) one years' wilful desertion and absence without
reasonable cause (5) extreme or repeated acts of cruelty, consisting
as well in the infliction of mental suffering as of
bodily violence; (6) failure on the part of the husband, being
in good bodily health, to make reasonable provision for his
family for the space of one year; (7) habitual drunkenness
of either spouse for the same period; (8) conviction of felony.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>Since the original statute of 1870, in Wyoming, a bigamous
contract or a marriage where the persons are related
within the forbidden degrees, or where either is insane or an
idiot, is void without judicial decree.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> In that state separation
from bed and board has never been sanctioned. Under
the existing law, as it has stood since 1882, absolute divorce
is allowed either person when aggrieved for (1) adultery; (2)
physical incompetence continuing from the time of the marriage;
(3) conviction of a felony and imprisonment therefor
in any prison, no subsequent pardon effecting a restitution
of conjugal rights; (4) wilful desertion for one year; (5)
when either husband or wife has become a habitual drunkard;
(6) extreme cruelty; (7) neglect of the husband for the
period of one year to provide the common necessaries of life,
unless such neglect is the result of poverty which he could not
have avoided by ordinary industry; (8) indignities rendering
the condition of either spouse intolerable; (9) conduct on the
part of the husband constituting him a vagrant within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
meaning of the law; (10) when before the marriage or its
solemnization either person shall have been convicted of a
felony or infamous crime in any state, territory, or count[r]y
without knowledge of the fact by the other at the time of
the marriage; (11) when the intended wife at the time of
contracting the marriage or its solemnization is pregnant by
any man other than her intended husband, and without the
latter's knowledge at the time of the solemnization.</p>

<p>Although there is no limited divorce in Wyoming, the
law in certain cases allows separate alimony to be granted to
the wife without a formal decree of separation.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>The legislation of Utah begins in 1852 with an act so
faulty that its consequences have become notorious in the
divorce annals of the United States. A vicious residence
clause, coupled with a loose requirement regarding notice
and an "omnibus" provision among the enumerated grounds
of complaint, became in effect a standing temptation to
clandestine divorce seekers from outside the territory. It is
formally declared that the court of probate of the county of
the plaintiff shall have jurisdiction in all petitions, and these
are to be made in writing upon oath or affirmation setting
forth the grounds of action. "If the court is satisfied," continues
the statute, "that the person so applying is a resident
of the Territory, or wishes to become one; and that the
application is made in sincerity and of" the plaintiff's "own
free will and choice, and for the purpose set forth in the
petition; then the court may decree a divorce from the bonds
of matrimony" against the defendant "for any of the following
causes, to wit": (1) impotence at the time of the marriage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
(2) adultery; (3) wilful desertion or absence without
reasonable cause for more than one year; (4) habitual drunkenness
subsequent to the marriage; (5) inhuman treatment
endangering life; (6) "when it shall be made to appear to
the satisfaction and conviction of the court, that the parties
cannot live in peace and union together, and that their welfare
requires a separation." Nevertheless, the courts are
encouraged to adopt a cautious and conservative policy.
They are allowed to defer "their decree of divorce, when the
same is applied for, to any specified time, not exceeding one
year, when it appears" that a compromise may be made; and
"during the time of such deference ... , the bonds and
engagements of matrimony may not be violated by the
parties." Furthermore, the court is empowered to punish
by fine or imprisonment or both any person "who shall stir
up unwarrantable litigation between husband and wife, or
seek to bring about a separation between them."</p>

<p>This statute was doubtless made in good faith. For,
although it remained in force without change for a quarter
of a century, it does not appear that the Latter Day Saints
showed any strong tendency to take advantage of its glaring
defects. But it is not surprising that evil should come of it.
The petitioner in a divorce suit need not be a "<i>bona fide</i> resident
of the territory. The formal expression of an intention
to become a resident was all that was required. The plea of
a citizen of any part of the United States that he intended
to become a citizen of Utah was entertained equally with
that of a regularly domiciled resident."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Besides, under the
"blanket" provision anything might be alleged in the petition
as a ground for action. The natural result was that
certain sharp lawyers in eastern cities seized the opportunity
to promote clandestine divorce on a large scale. Through
their skilful plans and the connivance of local judges, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
courts of several counties were converted into veritable
"divorce bureaus," so that between 1875 and 1877 there was
a surprising increase in the annual crop of divorce decrees.
Accordingly, in 1878 the assembly passed a statute which
effectually put an end to this anomalous state of affairs.
One year's <i>bona fide</i> residence was now required; a decree
was forbidden in case of default of the defendant except
on legal testimony; better provisions for notice were made;
and the "omnibus" clause was abandoned. By this act,
separation from bed and board is not provided for; but an
absolute divorce, in favor of the aggrieved, may be granted for
(1) impotence at the time of marriage; (2) adultery; (3)
wilful desertion for more than one year; (4) wilful neglect of
the husband to provide for the wife the common necessaries
of life; (5) habitual drunkenness; (6) conviction of felony;
(7) cruel treatment, to the extent of causing great bodily
injury or great mental distress.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> To these grounds in 1903
was added (8) permanent insanity, when the defendant has
been duly declared insane five years before.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Furthermore,
by an act of 1896 separate maintenance without a decree of
divorce is allowed the wife for desertion by the husband
or when, without her fault, she is living separate from him.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>By an act of 1853 the legislature of Oregon Territory
allows divorce petitions presented under oath to be determined
by the district court of the county in which the cause
occurs, or in which the defendant resides or is found, or in
which the plaintiff resides, if in this last case it be either the
county in which the parties last cohabited or that in which
the plaintiff has resided for six months next preceding the
action. Absolute divorce in favor of the aggrieved is permitted
on ten grounds. These are (1) impotence continuing
since marriage; (2) adultery committed since marriage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
remaining unforgiven; (3) bigamous contract; (4) compulsion
or gross fraud in procuring the marriage, if a rescission
be sought in a reasonable time after removal of the restraint
or discovery of the fraud; (5) wilful desertion for two years
without reasonable cause; (6) conviction of felony or infamous
crime; (7) habitual gross drunkenness contracted since
marriage; (8) harsh and cruel treatment; (9) personal indignities
rendering life burdensome; (10) six months' voluntary
neglect of the husband to provide the wife with a home and
the common necessaries of life.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> This statute was, however,
of short duration. In 1854 the third and fourth causes were
dropped; bigamous contracts and those entered into through
compulsion or fraud being now properly treated as grounds
for annulment of void or voidable marriages. The remaining
eight causes recognized in 1853 were retained, except that
the term of wilful desertion was reduced to one year; and a
period of one year was likewise fixed in case of voluntary
neglect to provide.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Eight years later neglect to provide
ceased to be a legal ground of complaint. At the same time
it was enacted that "habitual gross drunkenness" to constitute
a cause must exist for two years immediately before the
commencement of the suit; and the period of wilful desertion
was extended to three years.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>The law governing the grounds of action, as it still exists
in Oregon, took its present form in 1887; and, with the
exception of the one clause omitted in 1862, it is practically
the same as it was established in 1854. Separation from
bed and board is not recognized. The circuit courts, sitting
at least twice a year in each county, have jurisdiction. A
full divorce may be obtained on petition of the aggrieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for (1) impotence; (2) adultery; (3) conviction of felony; (4)
habitual gross drunkenness contracted since marriage and
continuing for one year prior to the commencement of the
suit; (5) wilful desertion for the period of one year; (6) cruel
and inhuman treatment or personal indignities rendering life
burdensome.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>The divorce laws of Washington have been remarkably
free from violent changes. The current of legislation has
run smoothly along. Separation from bed and board has
never been provided for; but eight causes of absolute divorce
were recognized by the first territorial act on the subject in
1854. These are (1) force or fraud in procuring the marriage,
provided there be no subsequent voluntary cohabitation;
(2) adultery unforgiven, if application be made within
one year after knowledge of the offense; (3) impotence; (4)
abandonment for one year; (5) cruel treatment; (6) habitual
drunkenness; (7) neglect or refusal of the husband to make
suitable provision for his family; (8) imprisonment in the
penitentiary, if complaint be filed during the term of such
confinement.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> In 1860 was added a new ground in the form
of an "omnibus" provision. A divorce was then permitted
on application of either spouse (9) "for any other cause
deemed by the court sufficient, or when the court shall be
satisfied that the parties can no longer live together."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Thus
the law remained without change for twenty-five years; but
in 1885 it was provided (10) that in "case of incurable,
chronic mania or dementia of either party, having existed
for ten years or more, the court may in its discretion grant
a divorce."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Finally in 1891 the list of grounds for full dissolution
of wedlock sanctioned by the present code of Washington
was completed. A full divorce is now allowed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
modification of the fifth cause above enumerated, (11) for
"personal indignities rendering life burdensome."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Originally
the district courts were vested with jurisdiction, but
since 1889 the superior courts in the separate counties have
had authority in all cases of divorce, alimony, and annulment.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>In 1851, at the second session of the state legislature,
California granted the district courts "within their respective
districts" jurisdiction in divorce questions. Nine causes
of "divorces from bed and board, or from the bonds of matrimony,"
were then recognized. But in 1874 three of these&mdash;natural
impotence, force or fraud, and the marriage of a
female under the age of fourteen years without consent of
parent or guardian or without ratification by her after reaching
that age&mdash;were dropped, and thereafter they were rightly
treated as grounds for annulment of voidable contracts. The
remaining six causes were then re-enacted, with some changes
in the prescribed conditions, but only as grounds of absolute
divorce. The statute of 1874 is still in force, full dissolution
of wedlock, but not separation from bed and board,
being sanctioned for (1) adultery; (2) extreme cruelty; (3)
wilful desertion; (4) wilful neglect; (5) habitual intemperance;
(6) conviction of felony.</p>

<p>After this formal enumeration of the grounds of petition,
the first code of California carefully defines the terms
employed and prescribes the conditions under which the law
shall take effect. Thus "wilful desertion, wilful neglect, or
habitual intemperance must continue for one year before
either is a ground for divorce." By the original act of 1851,
it may be noted, a period of three years was prescribed for
both wilful desertion and wilful neglect to provide. In 1853,
however, the term of wilful desertion was reduced to two
years; and the same time was fixed for wilful neglect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
1870. A period during which habitual intemperance must
exist to constitute a cause of divorce was not mentioned until
the statute of 1874, by which, in this case as well as in the
two others above named, the one-year term was required.
By the existing code extreme cruelty is defined as the
"infliction of grievous bodily injury or grievous mental suffering."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
"Wilful desertion is the voluntary separation of
one of the married parties from the other with the intent to
desert." But when one person is induced by the stratagem
or fraud of the other "to leave the family dwelling-place, or
to be absent, and during such absence the offending party
departs with intent to desert the other, it is desertion by the
party committing the stratagem or fraud, and not by the
other." In like manner "departure or absence of one party
from the dwelling-place, caused by cruelty or by threats of
bodily harm from which danger would be reasonably apprehended
from the other, is not desertion by the absent party
but it is desertion by the other." Separation by consent,
with or without the understanding that one of the married
persons will apply for a divorce, is not desertion. Moreover,
"absence or separation, proper in itself, becomes desertion
whenever the intent to desert is fixed during such absence
or separation."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Wilful neglect is defined as the neglect of
the husband to provide for his wife the common necessaries
of life, he having the ability to do so; or his failure to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as the result of "idleness, profligacy, or dissipation."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Finally, habitual intemperance is described as "that degree
of intemperance from the use of intoxicating drinks which
disqualifies the person a great portion of the time from properly
attending to business, or which would reasonably inflict
a cause of great mental anguish" upon the innocent person.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
In like spirit the reasons for denying a decree are minutely
specified by the law. Original jurisdiction in all questions
of divorce and annulment of marriage is now vested in the
superior courts in their respective counties or other districts.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>The California codes and decisions, as is well understood,
have been freely adopted or followed by a number of western
states. This is especially true regarding divorce legislation.
The causes and conditions of action recognized by California
law have often been accepted outright.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Such, for example,
is the case in Montana. By the code of 1895 the same six
causes sanctioned by the law of California since 1874 are
recognized; while the prescribed definitions, already in part
summarized from that law, are almost exactly reproduced.
The grounds for dissolution of wedlock are identical, except
in their phraseology, with those authorized by the original
Montana act of 1865, save that in addition impotence and
bigamous contract were then enumerated among the legal
causes of divorce. There is no separation from bed and
board in Montana; but the wife may be allowed separate
maintenance, although a decree of divorce is denied. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
1865 the respective district courts, on the chancery side,
have had jurisdiction in absolute divorce and in all questions
of alimony and annulment of voidable contracts.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>What has just been said of Montana may be repeated
for Idaho, where the California system was adopted in
1887.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> By an act of 1895, however, incurable insanity was
admitted as a seventh cause of full divorce.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> In this case,
as in all the others since 1864, the district court in the county
of the plaintiff has jurisdiction. Earlier the laws relating
to the causes were somewhat less closely patterned upon the
California statutes. The act of 1864 allows a full divorce
for (1) impotence at the time of the marriage; (2) adultery
committed since marriage and remaining unforgiven; (3)
wilful desertion for two years; (4) conviction of felony or
infamous crime; (5) habitual gross drunkenness, contracted
since marriage, incapacitating the offender from contributing
his or her share to the support of the family; (6) extreme
cruelty; (7) neglect of the husband for two years to provide
the common necessaries of life, unless such neglect is
the result of poverty which could not be avoided by ordinary
industry.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Three years later the California law, as it
then stood, allowing nine causes of full divorce, was adopted,
except that the terms of habitual intemperance and wilful
neglect were each fixed at two years, and a period of one
year was made sufficient for wilful desertion. It should also
be noted that this Idaho statute, unlike the contemporary law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of California, made no provision for partial divorce.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> It
was superseded in 1875 by a new act<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> which is identical in
its provision regarding the grounds of action with that of
1867; and no further change was made until the present
California plan was sanctioned in 1887.</p>

<p>The experience of the Dakotas has been very similar to
that of Idaho and Montana, so far as the final results are
concerned; but the early territorial legislation was often
clumsy in form, vicious in character, and subject to frequent
and violent changes. The original act of 1864 grants the
several district courts jurisdiction in petitions for absolute
dissolution of marriage on suit brought in the county where
the persons or one of them resides, for (1) adultery; (2) impotence;
(3) imprisonment in a penitentiary subsequently
to the marriage, no pardon effecting a restoration of conjugal
rights; (4) cruel and inhuman treatment, "whether
practised by using personal violence, or by any other
means"; (5) habitual drunkenness for one year next before
filing the complaint; (6) "when it shall be made fully to
appear that from any other reason or cause existing, the
parties cannot live in peace and happiness together, and
that their welfare requires a separation."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Separation from
bed and board is not contemplated by the law of 1864; but
in 1866 a new statute appears by which both kinds of
divorce are provided for. A full divorce is permitted only
on the scriptural ground; but a partial divorce "for life or
for a limited time" may be decreed in favor of the
aggrieved for (1) cruel treatment; (2) conduct rendering
cohabitation unsafe or improper; (3) abandonment, accompanied
by refusal to fulfil the matrimonial obligations sanctioned
by the statute. If in any case a decree of separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
be denied, the court may provide for the separate
maintenance of the wife and children by the husband or out
of his property.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The very next year this act was replaced
by another which allows the aggrieved spouse absolute
divorce for (1) bigamous contract; (2) wilful absence for
five years; (3) adultery; (4) impotency; (5) pregnancy of
the wife at the time of the marriage by a man other than
the husband without the latter's knowledge; (6) extreme
cruelty; (7) habitual drunkenness; (8) imprisonment in a
penitentiary anywhere in the United States for violation of
the criminal laws;<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> (9) whenever it shall be made to appear
that the husband or wife of the applicant "has obtained a
decree of divorce in any of the courts of any other territory
or state, by virtue of which the party who shall have
obtained such decree shall have been released from the obligation
of the marriage contract, while the same remains
binding upon the other party." Limited divorce is not
mentioned by this statute; but, in place of it, a wife may
obtain separate alimony for (1) the husband's adultery; (2)
his gross neglect of duty; (3) abandonment by him without
good cause; (4) where there is a separation in consequence of
his ill-treatment; (5) his habitual drunkenness; or (6) his confinement
in any prison in the country, or for any crime warranting
such punishment in the territory.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Only four years elapsed before the restless lawmaker was
again at work. By an act of 1871 a divorce from bed and
board or from the bonds of matrimony may be granted (1)
for impotence at the time of marriage; (2) "when the female
at the time of the alleged marriage was under the age of
fourteen years, and the alleged marriage was without the
consent of her parents, or guardians, or other persons having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the legal custody or charge of her person; and when such
marriage was not voluntarily ratified on her part" after the
attainment of that age; (3) for adultery; (4) for extreme
cruelty by the infliction of grievous bodily or mental suffering;
(5) for habitual intemperance; (6) for two years' wilful
desertion; (7) for having the ability to provide and failure
so to do on account of idleness, profligacy, or dissipation;
(8) "when from threatening words or acts, the weaker party
feels in danger of bodily injury;" (9) when the consent was
obtained by "force, fraud, intimidation, deception, or influence
of stronger minds;" (10) for conviction of felony after
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Here matters rested until 1877, when the California
system, including the six causes and the careful definitions
of the code, was adopted.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> This plan without change
is retained in the existing laws of South Dakota;<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> as also in
those of North Dakota, except that between 1899 and 1901,
following the lead of Idaho, incurable insanity for two years
was admitted as a seventh ground of absolute divorce.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> In
neither of these states is partial divorce recognized. The
district courts in North Dakota still have original jurisdiction;
while in South Dakota authority is vested in the circuit
courts within the respective circuits or their subdivisions.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Nevada has likewise closely followed the example of California.
Separation from bed and board has at no time been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
provided for. Bigamous marriages and those within the forbidden
degrees of consanguinity are void without decree or
other legal proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> But since 1875, with one exception,
the grounds of absolute divorce have been practically the
same as those prescribed by the California code, although
they are differently expressed, and there are not the same
minute provisions regarding the application of the law and
the conditions of action. On complaint of the aggrieved the
courts are now authorized to dissolve the bonds of wedlock
for (1) impotence at the time of the marriage continuing to
the time of divorce; (2) adultery since marriage, remaining
unforgiven; (3) wilful desertion for one year; (4) conviction
of felony or infamous crime; (5) habitual gross drunkenness,
contracted since marriage and incapacitating the offender
from contributing his or her share toward the support of the
family; (6) extreme cruelty; (7) neglect of the husband for
the period of one year to provide the common necessaries of
life, unless such neglect is the result of poverty which could
not have been avoided by ordinary industry. Thus the
laws of Nevada regarding the causes of divorce have been
remarkably free from change; for the statute of 1875 in this
regard is identical with the original act of 1861, except that
by the latter the terms of wilful desertion and wilful neglect
to provide are each fixed at two years.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>For Alaska the act of Congress does not authorize partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
divorce; but marriage may be dissolved for (1) impotency;
(2) adultery; (3) conviction of felony; (4) two years' wilful
desertion; (5) "cruel and inhuman treatment, calculated to
impair health or endanger life;" or (6) habitual gross
drunkenness contracted since marriage and continuing one

<p>By the law of Hawaii both kinds of divorce are provided
for. Separation from bed and board forever or for a limited
time will be granted when either spouse has been guilty of
(1) excessive and habitual ill-treatment; or (2) habitual
drunkenness; and (3) to the wife for the husband's neglect
or refusal to provide her with the necessaries of life. At
any time, on joint application of the persons, with satisfactory
evidence of reconciliation, the decree of separation may
be revoked by the court. According to a unique scheme,
the grounds of absolute divorce are arranged in two groups:
(1) A marriage will be dissolved, on petition of the aggrieved,
when either consort has (<i>a</i>) committed adultery; (<i>b</i>) is
guilty of three years' wilful and utter desertion; (<i>c</i>) has
been sentenced to imprisonment for life, or for seven years
or more, no pardon effecting a restitution of conjugal rights;
or (<i>d</i>) has contracted "the disease known as Chinese leprosy,
and is incapable of cure." (2) When one of the married persons
has been guilty of (<i>a</i>) extreme cruelty; or (<i>b</i>) habitual
drunkenness; and (<i>c</i>) when the husband, being of sufficient
ability to provide suitable maintenance for his wife, neglects
or refuses so to do. But it is especially enacted that if the
person applying for a decree "shall not insist upon a divorce
from the bond of matrimony, a divorce only from bed and
board shall be granted." Jurisdiction is vested in the circuit
courts of the circuit where the persons last cohabited
as husband and wife; but no divorce for any cause will be
allowed if they have never so lived together in the territory.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p><i>c</i>) <i>Remarriage, residence, notice, and miscellaneous provisions.</i>&mdash;It
has been found convenient in the preceding section
to trace throughout the period the development of the
New York law regarding the remarriage of divorced persons.
By the original statute of 1787, it thus appears, the guilty
defendant is forever prohibited from marrying again. Under
the acts of 1813 and 1827-28 the restriction is limited to
the lifetime of the innocent former spouse; and this rule is
retained in the present law, although in harmony with the
practice elsewhere widely prevailing, the parties to the action
are at liberty to renew their matrimonial vows. The defendant,
however, may marry again in case the court in which
the judgment is given "shall in that respect modify such
judgment, which modification shall only be made upon satisfactory
proof that the complainant has remarried, that five
years have elapsed since the decree of divorce was rendered,
and that the conduct of the defendant since the dissolution
of said marriage has been uniformly good."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> At no time,
apparently, has any legal check been put upon the immediate
remarriage of the successful plaintiff after final decree; and
a way has been found by which the guilty defendant may at
once contract further wedlock through evasion of the statute.
In 1881 the precedent established by Massachusetts in 1829
was followed by the New York court of appeals. It was
then decided that when a husband who has been divorced in
New York for his adultery "goes into another state for the
purpose of evading our law, and there contracts a second marriage
during the lifetime of his former wife, and immediately
returns to and resides within this state, such second marriage
is, nevertheless, valid, and the issue thereof legitimate."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
On the other hand, it is held that the restraint applies to the
remarriage of divorced persons even when the divorce was
granted in another state. Thus dower was "denied on a
showing that the deceased husband, while a resident of
Massachusetts, had been divorced from his wife for his fault
and later had removed to New York and married the plaintiff
while his former wife was living. It was held that the New
York statutes governed whether the divorce was granted in
that state or not, so long as the marriage was celebrated in
New York."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> But elsewhere the courts have taken the opposite
position, holding that the restraint on remarriage applies
only to divorces granted in the state where it is imposed.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>During the century the statutes of New Jersey have in
effect, though not expressly, allowed either person absolute
freedom of remarriage after divorce.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> A different rule has
been followed in Pennsylvania and Delaware. By a law of
the former state in 1785, "he or she, who hath been guilty
of the adultery, may not marry the person with whom the
said crime was committed, during the life of the former
husband or wife."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> This provision is still in force; and,
except in the single case specified, the law of that state puts
no restriction whatever upon the remarriage of either person
after a decree dissolving the marriage tie. Since 1832 with
respect to remarriage the law of Delaware has in substance
been identical with that of the sister-commonwealth, except
that the prohibition of marriage with the paramour is not
confined to the lifetime of the former spouse.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>By their complete silence on the subject the statutes of
Ohio appear always to have allowed either person entire
freedom of remarriage after divorce. Since 1831 the same
liberty has been expressly granted by the laws of Indiana;<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
except that when the defendant has been "constructively"
summoned without other notice than publication in a newspaper,
the person obtaining a decree of divorce is not permitted
to marry again until the expiration of two years, during
which period the judgment may be opened at the instance
of the defendant.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> But by the original act of 1818 the
offender is not released from the bonds of matrimony while
his former spouse is living.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> This restriction is maintained
by the statute of 1824, unless the court in its discretion,

grant a release.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> In 1825 the legislature of Illinois required

<p>The legislation of the newer states of the Mississippi valley
and the Pacific slope discloses the same lack of harmony
in dealing with the question in hand. By the laws of Wyoming,
Utah, and Nevada either spouse, whether guilty or
innocent, is left absolutely free to contract further wedlock
as soon as he likes after divorce. At present the same is
true of Iowa, although under the early enactments the guilty
defendant was forbidden to remarry.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> In Kansas, by a statute

<p>Until very recently in California no clear restraint was
put upon further wedlock after full separation. In 1897,
following the example of Colorado, the legislature provided
that in case of dissolution a new marriage may validly be
contracted by either person only when the decree of divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
has been rendered at least one year before.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> This amendment,
it seems, was designed primarily to remedy an abuse
arising in the uncertainties of California law&mdash;one often encouraged
by careless legislation in the United States. Its
purpose, says Judge Belcher in the opinion below cited,
"was to correct a great public evil which had become too
rife&mdash;to put a stop to marriages within the period allowed
for the appeal from the decree of divorce, which might be
and sometimes had been reversed, with great scandal to the
parties who had married again." In the meantime this new
and stringent provision has given occasion for still more
serious evils originating in the inharmonious laws of adjacent
states. The statutes of Nevada, whose borders are
within easy reach of San Francisco, have not fixed a period
within which divorced persons may not contract further wedlock.
As a result, Reno has become the Gretna Green of
California couples who there seek to evade the interdict of
their own law. Whether a person who retains his domicile
in California may contract a valid marriage in Nevada within
less than one year after having been divorced in the former
state is a question regarding which the decisions of the superior
courts long contradicted one another.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> But the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
tribunal has just determined<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> that California in this regard
is to take her place by the side of New York and Massachusetts,
whose example Washington had already followed.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> To
overcome the effect of this decision, the legislature has
enacted that if in any case the court "determines that a
divorce ought to be granted an interlocutory judgment must
be entered, declaring that the party in whose favor the court
decides is entitled to a divorce." After one year has expired,
on its own motion or the motion of either person, the court
"may enter final judgment granting the divorce," unless
action on appeal or on a motion for a new trial is pending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"In no case can a marriage of either of the parties during
the life of the other be valid in this state, if contracted within
one year after the entry of an interlocutory decree." But
this legislation,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> it is believed, will be declared unconstitutional
by the supreme court.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>Expressly or by implication the divorced couple are
excepted from the restraint, and permitted to rewed in
Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, New
York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, and
Washington. On the question whether, in the absence of
statutory authority, such remarriage of the divorced persons
comes within the restraint, the decisions of the courts are
conflicting.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>All of the twenty-six states under consideration have
prescribed rules or conditions regarding the residence of the
plaintiff in divorce suits. In nearly every instance a definite
term of previous residence in the state, or in the state and
in the county, of the action is fixed. This term varies from
six months to three years, one year being the prevailing
period. In the West the requirements in this regard are
not in general so rigid as in some eastern and southern
states; but during the past two decades encouraging progress
has been made.</p>

<p>The law of New York governing residence has in the
preceding subsection already been presented. A fixed term
is not prescribed, except that in cases of partial divorce,
when the marriage was solemnized outside the state, the
persons must have "continued to be residents" of the state
for at least one year, and the plaintiff must be resident at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the time the action is commenced.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Delaware has not fixed
a definite period of residence; but no divorce from the bond
of matrimony will be decreed when the cause assigned
therefor in the petition occurred out of the state and the
"petitioner was a non-resident thereof at the time of its
occurrence, unless for the same or like cause such divorce
would be allowed by the laws of the state or country in
which it is alleged to have occurred."<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Delaware, like Maine
and Massachusetts, has attempted to prevent clandestine
divorce through evasion of the laws. "When any inhabitant
... shall go into any other jurisdiction to obtain a divorce
for any cause occurring here; or for any cause which would
not authorize a divorce by the laws of this state; a divorce
so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The

within the state, and the complainant is an actual resident at
the time the injury arose, and at the time of exhibiting the
bill; when the adultery occurred within the state and either
spouse is a resident thereof at the commencement of the
suit; or when one of the persons, at the time of filing the

The legislation of Michigan shows similar vicissitudes. The
act of 1819 allows an absolute divorce for adultery when the
parties are "inhabitants" of the territory, or when the marriage
was solemnized therein, and the injured person is an
actual resident at the time of the offense and at the time the
complaint is filed.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> In 1832 a residence of three years was

time in 1844.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The period of one year is still sanctioned
when the cause of action occurs within the state. By the
careful act of May 26, 1899, no decree of divorce will be
granted in any case unless (1) the plaintiff has resided in
the state for one year preceding; or (2) the marriage sought
to be dissolved was solemnized in the state and the plaintiff
has since resided therein to the time of the petition. Furthermore,
in no case will a decree be granted unless (1) the
defendant is domiciled in the state when the petition is filed;
or (2) was so domiciled when the alleged cause for the action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
arose; or (3) when he voluntarily appears at the trial, or is
brought in by publication, or has been personally served
with process or notice. On the other hand, when the
cause of action occurs outside the state, a divorce will not be
allowed unless the complainant or the defendant shall have
resided in the commonwealth for two years immediately
before the filing of the petition. If the defendant is not
domiciled in the state at the time of commencing the suit, or
when the alleged cause arose, before a decree will be granted
the complainant must prove that the parties have actually
lived and cohabited together as husband and wife within
the state, or that the complainant has there resided in good
faith for the two preceding years.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

1899;<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and in Wyoming since 1901.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> In Alaska by the
federal law of 1903, the plaintiff must be an inhabitant of
the district for two years before suit is brought; and the
same term had already been prescribed for Hawaii.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Four states are less stringent in their requirements. In
Nebraska, since 1856, petition will not be granted unless
the plaintiff has resided in the state for six months, except
when the marriage was solemnized in the state and the plaintiff
has there dwelt since the marriage to the time when
the suit is commenced.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The same term has been required
in Idaho since 1864;<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> while in Nevada, since 1861, the
plaintiff must have resided six months in the county
where suit is brought, unless the action is begun "in the
county in which the cause thereof shall have accrued, or in
which the defendant shall reside, or be found, or in
which the plaintiff shall reside if the latter be the county
in which the parties last cohabited."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Until 1899, as in the
territorial stage, South Dakota required only ninety days'
<i>bona fide</i> residence on the part of the plaintiff. In that year
the term was increased to six months; but in no case will a
divorce be granted without personal service within the state,
or, when the defendant is non-resident, personal service and
order of publication "until the plaintiff shall have a <i>bona
fide</i> residence in the state for one year" next before the
granting of a decree.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The laws of every state in this group contain some provision
requiring notice to the defendant when personal
service cannot be had. Such notice is given as in equity
suits in Illinois and Nebraska; as in ordinary civil actions
in California,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington,
Wisconsin,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and Wyoming; and in the remaining commonwealths
special rules regarding publication, usually in the
newspapers, are in force.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>The miscellaneous provisions regarding divorce and divorce
actions are in character similar to those already mentioned
for other states. In California, Hawaii, Illinois,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North
Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wyoming the legitimacy of
the children of the marriage is expressly recognized in case of
divorce. Trial by jury in the finding of facts is allowed in Illinois,
Nevada, New York,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; while
in Washington it is expressly denied; and in Colorado the guilt
or innocence of the defendant must be determined by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
verdict in every case.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The statutes of Kansas, Nebraska,
Ohio, Wisconsin, and Wyoming permit either consort to be a
witness in the case; and by those of Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota,
Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington
the court may authorize the woman to change her name.
She is granted this privilege in Alaska only when not the
person in fault. In several instances special provision is
made for defending the action. According to the Indiana
law, "when a petition for divorce remains undefended, it
shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney to appear and
resist" the same.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> In Colorado, when the defendant fails
to appear, the court must appoint an attorney who shall
secure a fair and impartial hearing of the case.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> By the
law of Oregon the state is constituted a party in such suits,
and it is the duty of the district attorney, "so far as may
be necessary to prevent fraud or collusion," to control the
proceedings for the defense.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Washington has a similar
law;<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and in special cases the prosecuting attorney in Idaho
and Michigan is likewise required to oppose the granting of
a decree.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Soliciting divorce business by advertising or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
otherwise is sometimes prohibited under severe penalty,
such being the case in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota,
Montana, New York, Ohio, and Washington.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Indiana has
a unique enactment expressly declaring that a divorce legally
granted in any other state shall have full effect in that commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Everywhere due provision is made for alimony,
care of the children, and the adjustment of property rights.
There is great variation in matters of detail; but in general
the laws of the middle and western states relating to these
subjects are very similar to those of New England. For the
purpose of the present chapter further notice may therefore
be dispensed with. Only in Michigan,<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Ohio, Illinois, and
Indiana, it may be mentioned in conclusion, has any adequate
provision been made for the collection and publication
of divorce statistics.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

PROBLEMS OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY</h3>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note XVIII.</span>&mdash;Materials for a more extended
study of the questions touched upon in this chapter are set forth in
Part IV of the Bibliographical Index. Wright's <i>Report on Marriage
and Divorce</i> is, of course, indispensable. It may be supplemented
from the <i>Eleventh Census, U. S.</i>, I; the <i>Census of Massachusetts</i>, 1875,
1885, 1895; the <i>Registration Reports</i> of the New England states, of
which the forty-first for Massachusetts is most important; and from
those of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. Useful summaries of
statistics may also be found in Secretary Dike's <i>Reports of the National
Divorce Reform League</i>, and its successor, the <i>National League for
the Protection of the Family</i> (Montpelier and Boston, 1886-1903). An
important statistical monograph is Willcox's <i>Divorce Problem</i> (2d ed.,
New York, 1897). This should be read in connection with his "Study
in Vital Statistics," in <i>Pol. Science Quarterly</i>, VIII (New York, 1893);
his "Marriage Rate in Michigan," in <i>Pub. of Am. Stat. Association</i>,
IV (Boston, 1895); Crum's "Marriage Rate in Massachusetts," in the
same volume; and Kuczynski's article in <i>Quart. Jour. of Economics</i>,

<p>In Italy divorce is favored by Gioja, <i>Teoria civile e penale del
divorzio</i> (Milan, 1803); Mazzoleni, <i>La famiglia nei rapporti coll individuo
e colla società</i> (Milan, 1870); Bianchi, <i>Il divorzio</i> (Pisa, 1879);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Bernardo, <i>Il divorzio nella teoria e nella pratica</i> (Palermo, 1875);
Marescalchi, <i>Il divorzio e la instituzione sua in Italia</i> (Rome, 1889);
and opposed by Giudici, <i>Memoria sul divorzio</i> (Milan, 1798); Rosmini,
<i>Des lois civiles concernant le mariage des chrétiens</i> (trans., Paris, 1853);
Zamperini, <i>Il divorzio considerato nella teoria e nella pratica di D. di
Bernardo</i> (Verona, 1876); and Gabba, "The Introduction of Divorce in
Italy," in <i>Am. Church Review</i>, XXXIII (New York, 1881). In France
the rise of a sentiment favoring divorce may be traced in <i>Cri d'une
honnête femme qui reclame le divorce</i> (London, 1770); <i>Contrat conjugal</i>
(Paris, 1781; Neuchatel, 1783); Bouchotte, <i>Observations sur le divorce</i>

Bertillon, in the works above cited; Cavilly, <i>La séparation de corps et
le divorce</i> (Paris, 1882); Fiaux, <i>La femme, le mariage, et le divorce</i>
(Paris, 1880); and Dumas, <i>La question du divorce</i> (Paris, 1879; 5th ed.,
1880). Divorce is opposed by Madame Necker, <i>Réflexions sur le divorce</i>
(Paris, 1792; or Lausanne, 1794); Bonald, <i>Du divorce</i> (Paris, 1801); Malleville,
<i>Du divorce</i> (Paris, 1801); Chrestien, <i>Dissertation historique</i> (Paris,
1804); Hennequin, <i>Du divorce</i> (Paris, 1832); Ozanam, "Du divorce," in

Napoléon</i> (Paris, 1870); Durrieux, <i>Du divorce</i> (Paris, 1881); Vidieu,
<i>Famille et divorce</i> (Paris, 1879). This book was answered by Dumas in
the work just cited; and he in turn was replied to by Féval, <i>Pas de
divorce</i> (11th ed., Paris, 1880); and Hornstein, <i>Le divorce</i> (Paris, 1880).
Kellen, <i>Was ist die Frau?</i> (Leipzig, 1892) gives an account, with
extracts, of Dumas's utterances on social questions.</p>

<h4>I. THE FUNCTION OF LEGISLATION</h4>

<p>In the United States, not less clearly than elsewhere in
countries of western civilization, marriage and the family are
emerging as purely social institutions. Liberated in large
measure from the cloud of mediæval tradition, their problems
are seen to be identical in kind with those which have
everywhere concerned men and women from the infancy of
the human race. Accordingly, the extension of the sphere
of secular legislation practically to the entire province of
these institutions is a phenomenon of surpassing interest.
Consciously or unconsciously, it is a recognition of the fact
that matrimonial forms and family types are the products of
human experience, of human habits, and are therefore to be
dealt with by society according to human needs. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
regard the Reformation marks the beginning of a social
revolution. From the days of Luther, however concealed in
theological garb or forced under theological sanctions, however
opposed by reactionary dogma, public opinion has more
and more decidedly recognized the right of the temporal
lawmaker in this field. In the seventeenth century the
New England Puritan gave the state, in its assemblies and
in its courts, complete jurisdiction in questions of marriage
and divorce, to the entire exclusion of the ecclesiastical
authority. Even the Council of Trent, by adjusting the
dogma regarding the minister of the sacrament, had already
left to Catholic states the way open for the civil regulation
of matrimony&mdash;a way, as already seen, on which France did
not hesitate to enter.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Later the French Revolution wrested
from the church judicial and legislative authority in matrimonial
law and administration, and placed it in the hands of
the state. In 1792, by a wise and tolerant enactment, civil
marriage and civil registration were established; but at the
same time the revolt against the old ecclesiastical régime led
to the sanction of free divorce. Absolute dissolution of
wedlock was then authorized at the mutual desire of both
husband and wife, for incompatibility of temper on the petition
of either spouse, and for seven other specified causes.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
The natural result was a vast number of decrees.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Accordingly,
in 1803 the Code Napoléon, while retaining civil marriage,
adopted a more conservative policy regarding divorce.
Incompatibility was no longer recognized; mutual consent
was admitted under limitations; and the whole number of
specified causes was reduced to five. The divorce law of
1803 was abrogated in 1816, and only restored in its
essential features in 1884; but the liberal policy of France,
as expressed in the Code Napoléon, has undoubtedly had
a powerful influence in the extension of civil marriage
and divorce throughout Europe, where, as in America, the
modern statute-maker has recovered and passed beyond the
point gained by the Roman imperial constitutions between
Augustus and Justinian.</p>

<p>The right of society to deal freely with the whole province
of marriage, divorce, and the family may be conceded.
To determine the proper character and sphere of legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
is a very different matter. What is the quality of the
existing laws under the interpretation given to them by the
courts? Are they adequate to secure proper social control?
What is the legitimate aim, and what are the needful limits
of future legislation? Should the laws be uniform for the
fifty-three states and territories; and, if so, how is uniformity
to be attained? These are practical questions with whose solution
it is high time that society should more earnestly concern
itself.</p>

<p><i>a</i>) <i>The statutes and the common-law marriage.</i>&mdash;The defects
in the matrimonial laws of the United States are many
and grave; but perhaps the chief obstacle in the way of
securing a proper social control is the general recognition of
the validity of the so-called "common-law marriage." Almost
everywhere the public celebration of wedlock is intended by
the statute; and in nearly all the states a license or certificate
is required before the solemnization may take place.
Yet, according to the prevailing doctrine, as expressed in
judicial decisions or in the statutes themselves, these provisions
are interpreted as merely "directory," not "mandatory;"
and marriage contracts made in total disregard of them, by
words of mutual present consent, are sustained as valid,
although the prescribed penalties may be enforced for violation
of the written law. In short, the vicious mediæval distinction
between validity and legality is retained as an
element of common matrimonial law in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine that an informal marriage <i>per verba de
praesenti</i> is valid unless expressly declared void by "words
of nullity" in the statute is not an invention of the American
courts. It is the doctrine maintained by the English judges
previous to the decision in the case of the Queen <i>v.</i> Millis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
1844; and from the evidence already presented<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> it seems
almost certain, if indeed it be not demonstrated, that it was
the accepted doctrine in the English colonies. According
to an able writer, the colonial statutory "system" entirely
superseded the common law; and this system has been "destroyed"
by a revolution, effected through the decisions of
the American courts, "which has introduced into our law
much of the insecurity, the irreverence, the license, of the
Middle Ages," our common law today being "the canon law
that existed prior to the Council of Trent."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> No doubt our
common-law marriage is thoroughly bad, involving social
evils of the most dangerous character; and no doubt the
colonial legislative system was a remarkable advance upon
anything which had elsewhere appeared. But the common-law
marriage was not introduced by the American judges;
nor is it historically correct to say that in the English
colonies it had been entirely supplanted by legislation, however
admirable in its intent and quality that legislation may
have been. For the colonial period, as elsewhere shown, the
relation of the statutes governing marriage to the common
law can only partially be determined from the court records.
In the southern colonies the judicial history of the subject is
almost a complete blank.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Other evidence, however, is available.
Only during the thirty-five years between 1661 and
1696 does any statute of Virginia expressly declare a marriage
void if not contracted according to its provisions. The
new law of 1696, enacted in place of the statute of 1661/2,
which was then repealed, declares that "many great and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
grievous mischeifes ... dayly doe arise by clandestine
and secret marriages to the utter ruin of many heirs and
heiresses;" and yet it is significant that the words of nullity
contained in the earlier act are omitted. Indeed, by the
terms of this law the validity of an irregular marriage thereafter
contracted by a female between the ages of twelve and
sixteen is clearly implied, although she is to be severely
punished.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> Dissenters had refused to marry according to the
statute which they regarded as oppressive; and their resistance,
perhaps with a feeling that the act of 1661/2 was
itself invalid as being in conflict with the English common
law, may have led to the omission of the words of nullity in
all subsequent statutes of Virginia. After 1696 irregular
marriages were probably regarded as valid, as they certainly
were previous to 1661/2; for an act of 1642/3, while prescribing
severe penalties for the secret marriage of indented
servants, shows beyond question that such a contract, or one
between a freeman and an indented maid servant, is looked
upon as binding.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> The facts are much the same for the
other southern colonies. After 1692 the invalidating clause
disappears from the statutes of Maryland. Only between
1766 and 1778, in North Carolina, is a marriage contracted
without previous license expressly declared to be null and
void; and it is enlightening that even during this short
period of twelve years the penalty of invalidity is not extended
to illegal celebration. It was mainly a device of the
lawmaker to secure the governor in his revenue from the
license fees. The South Carolina act of 1706 merely prescribes
penalties for its violation; and, besides, its provisions
relating to the celebration were entirely disregarded in the
western country, where the various religious sects made use
of civil forms or practiced their own peculiar rites. In both
the Carolinas as well as in Georgia, since marriages illegally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
celebrated before unauthorized laymen or ministers seem to
have been valid, there is little reason to doubt that clandestine
and other informal contracts by present consent of the
parties were likewise good; but regarding this point we have
no positive information.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>The history of marriage in the middle and the New England
colonies leads us to a similar result. From the facts
brought to light in the Lauderdale Peerage case, backed by
the testimony of Rev. John Rodgers in 1773, it is almost
certainly established that the common-law marriage was
valid in New York province, and that for eighty-four years
preceding the Revolution no other law relating to the subject
was in force.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> In New England the formalities prescribed
by the statutes were doubtless usually observed.
Yet there were many clandestine and other irregular marriages,
and in some instances we know that these were treated
as valid.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Such was the case in the Plymouth jurisdiction,
where "self-marriage" was punished only by a fine. In
Massachusetts similar cases of "hand-fasting" and "self-gifta"
appear. In one case, that of Governor Bellingham
in 1641, the contract was not declared void by the court,
although the grand jury had presented his excellency for
his offense. Fifteen years later Joseph Hills, "being presented
by the grand jury for marrying of himself contrary
to the law of the colony," confessed his fault and was merely
"admonished by the court."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Moreover, at no time during
the colonial and provincial periods did the statutes of Massachusetts
expressly declare marriages void for disregard of
the celebration or other formalities prescribed;<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
same is true of the daughter-colony of Connecticut. By the
Rhode Island acts of 1647 and 1665 the issue of a union not
formed by the "due and orderly course of law" is pronounced
illegitimate; but it is very suggestive that the
words of nullity do not appear in any of the later statutes
of that province. Occasionally in the colonies statutes were
enacted to validate irregular marriages previously contracted.
Such were the acts of Rhode Island, 1698; of North Carolina,
1766; and of Virginia, 1780. But it would clearly be
rash to infer that the marriages concerned were in fact void
without such special intervention. Notoriously this is but a
speedy and simple way of quieting doubt as to the status of
the children or their rights of property and inheritance.
Whether a court would nullify the contracts in question is a
different matter. On the whole, the evidence seems clearly
to show that the colonial statutes sustained the same relation
to the English common law as did the constitutions of the
English church requiring the solemnization of wedlock
before a clergyman. The colonial statute, like the ecclesiastical
constitution, might determine the legal forms which
must be observed to escape a penalty; but the common-law
marriage was nevertheless valid unless expressly declared
null and void in the act itself. Furthermore, it is by no
means certain that the colonial assemblies were generally
competent, even in this way, to set aside the common law.</p>

<p>After the beginning of independent national life the English
common law as a whole in its various branches was
retained as a part of the law of the land, unless superseded
by constitutional or statutory legislation. It was therefore
inevitable that the state and federal courts, as cases arose,
should declare whether it had been so superseded. There
could no longer be any question, as in the colonial period,
regarding the competency of the legislator to define the conditions
of a valid matrimonial contract. A brief history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the acceptance or rejection of the common-law marriage in
the United States, whether by statute or by judicial decree,
may now be presented.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>The leading case came before the supreme court of New
York in 1809, when Chief Justice Kent accepted as binding
a common-law marriage, declaring that no solemnization was
requisite; that "a contract of marriage made <i>per verba de
praesenti</i> amounts to an actual marriage, and is as valid as
if made in <i>facie ecclesiae</i>;" and that the existence of such
a contract may be proved "from cohabitation, reputation,
acknowledgment of the parties, acceptance in the family, and
other circumstances from which a marriage may be inferred."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
This decision determined the policy of New York for nearly
a century, until the common-law marriage was at last superseded
by the statute of 1901; and its influence upon the
tribunals of other states has been increased through the
sanction of its doctrine by the leading authorities upon
matrimonial law.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> The contract by mere present consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the parties, regardless of the statutory requirements, has
been widely accepted as valid in the group of southern and
southwestern states and territories. It was so judicially
accepted in South Carolina<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> at least as early as 1832; in
Louisiana<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> in 1833; Georgia<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> in 1860; District of Columbia<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
in 1865; Alabama<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> in 1869; Arkansas<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> in 1872; Missouri<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
in 1877; and Florida<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> in 1880. By the earlier decisions of
Tennessee a strict compliance with the statute was required,
the court even declaring in 1829<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> that a marriage solemnized
before a justice of the peace out of his own county was
"absolutely null and void." This opinion was sustained by
a decree of 1831; but later judgments favor the common-law
agreement. Texas has had a similar experience. In
1883 and again in 1894 the common-law contract was repudiated,
the court deciding that license and parental consent
according to the statute were essential;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> but more recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

Michigan, declares Judge Cooley decisively in 1875&mdash;in an
opinion accepted as authority by the federal courts&mdash;a marriage
may be good, although the statutory regulations have
not been complied with. "Whatever the form of ceremony,
or even if all ceremony was dispensed with, if the parties
agreed presently to take each other for husband and wife,
and from that time lived together professedly in that relation,
proof of these facts would be sufficient to constitute
proof" of a binding marriage; and "this," he adds, "has
become the settled doctrine of the American courts."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> This

Moreover, the Supreme Court of the United States has sanctioned
the same doctrine. In Jewell <i>v.</i> Jewell,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> considered
in 1843, opinions on the question were evenly balanced, just
as they were in the Queen <i>v.</i> Millis which came before the
Lords during the next year; but in 1877, in the case of
Meister <i>v.</i> Moore,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> involving a marriage contracted under the
law of Michigan, Justice Strong adopted "as authoritative"
Judge Cooley's interpretation rendered two years before.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a number of states the courts have
decided that the common-law marriage is entirely superseded
by the statutes, even when these do not contain words of
nullity, and sometimes when they are expressed in terms far
less "mandatory" than in some instances where the opposite
doctrine prevails.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> In the words of a writer who believes
the courts are historically and logically justified in this view,
"they affirm that when from a comparative study of the
whole course of legislation as well as of the terms of the
various statutes, it is the plain intent to make conformity to
any statutory formality indispensable to the constitution of
marriage, such common law is <i>ipso facto</i> repealed, and a
marriage celebrated by mere consent, without this formality,
has no validity whatever in law. One such indispensable
formality, at least, they find in the intent of the statutes,
namely, the presence at the celebration of an authorized
third person."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> First to take this position was Massachusetts
in 1810, the year after Kent's opposite decision already
cited, when Chief Justice Parsons, in an opinion which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
been steadily sustained ever since, but which is not remarkable
for historical knowledge, held that "when our ancestors
left England, and ever since, it is well known that a
lawful [valid?] marriage there must be celebrated before
a clergyman in orders;" and hence in Massachusetts,
although "not declared void by any statute," a "marriage
merely the effect of a mutual engagement between the
parties, or solemnized by any one not a justice of the peace
or an ordained minister, is not a legal marriage, entitled to
the incidents of a marriage duly solemnized."<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Since 1848
the Massachusetts doctrine has been followed by Vermont.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
In the same year it was adopted in New Hampshire;<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> but in
the absence of more recent decisions the law of that state
cannot be regarded as absolutely settled. It was favored in
Maine<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> by a decision of 1841, although the informal contract
was not then positively rejected by a direct decree.
The courts of Connecticut are silent on the question; but
the statute declares that all marriages "attempted to be
solemnized by any other person" than those authorized by
it "shall be void."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Several states of the South have taken a similar stand.
Maryland<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and North Carolina<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> have thus repudiated the
common-law agreement, a formal celebration being made
essential to a valid marriage. The supreme court of West
Virginia has gone farther, holding that not only solemnization,
but also license and other prescribed formalities, are
requisite. "Our statute," runs a decision of 1887, "has
wholly superseded the common law, and in effect, if not in
express terms, renders invalid all attempted marriages contracted
in this state, which have not been solemnized in
compliance with its provisions.... When the terms of
the statute are such that they cannot be made effective, to
the extent of giving each and all of them some reasonable
operation, without interpreting the statutes as mandatory,
then such interpretation should be given them."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> In 1821
the common-law contract was judicially accepted in Kentucky;<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
but by the model statute of 1852&mdash;remarkable for
clearness and terseness&mdash;a "marriage is prohibited and
declared void when not solemnized or contracted in the
presence of an authorized person or society."<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Likewise in
Mississippi until recently the informal agreement was held
sufficient to constitute the parties husband and wife;<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
since 1892 the statute renders a marriage invalid if contracted
or solemnized without a previous license.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Moreover,
in Porto Rico, by the code of 1902, the authorization
and celebration of the contract "according to the forms and
solemnities prescribed by law" are requisite for a valid marriage.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
With these six southern and the four New England
commonwealths must be classed five states of the middle and
western division. Two of these&mdash;Oregon<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> since 1870 and
Washington<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> since 1892&mdash;have proceeded by judicial decree;
and three&mdash;California<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> in 1895, Utah<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> in 1898, and New
York<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> in 1901&mdash;have superseded the common-law agreement
by statutes containing the nullifying clause.</p>

<p>All the other states and territories have enacted laws
governing the celebration and other preliminaries of
marriage; but whether these laws are to be regarded as
mandatory or merely directory has not yet been judicially
determined. The courts are thus silent in Connecticut and
Rhode Island,<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> of the New England group; in Arizona,
Indian Territory, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Virginia, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the southern and southwestern group; in Alaska, Delaware,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and
Wyoming,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> of the middle and western division. Of these
Delaware, Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and Connecticut would probably reject
the common-law doctrine, were the question brought to a
judicial test; while it would almost certainly be accepted by
the courts of the other twelve states and territories, should
the statutes remain as they are. Indeed, in a number of the
last-named states, notably in Idaho, Montana, and South
Dakota, it is virtually sanctioned by the terms of the statutes
themselves.</p>

<p>It appears, then&mdash;to summarize the details presented in
the foregoing discussion&mdash;that twenty-three states and territories
have already sanctioned or favored the common-law
marriage; while twelve others are soon likely to do so, unless
the statutes shall be changed. On the contrary, eighteen
commonwealths have repudiated or are inclined to repudiate
the informal agreement. Six of these, it should be noted, have
liberated themselves by statute; five&mdash;Mississippi, California,
Utah, New York, and Porto Rico<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>&mdash;having done so within
the last ten years. This is a fact of vast social importance.
From it the reformer may gather new courage. In such
legislation, in response to a better-educated popular sentiment,
lies the hope of the future: to free American society
from the manifold evils which lurk in the doctrine of the
common-law marriage. It is, indeed, marvelous that a progressive
people with respect to an institution which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
very basis of the social order should so long neglect the
function of proper public control. For what, according to
its nature, is the common-law marriage? Its possibilities
for anarchy are realistically described by Chief Justice
Folger, of New York, in 1880, when that state was still
exposed to them. "A man and a woman," he declares, "who
are competent to marry each other, without going before a
minister or magistrate, without the presence of any person
as a witness, with no previous public notice given, with no
form or ceremony, civil or religious, and with no record or
written evidence of the act kept, and merely by words of
present contract between them, may take upon themselves
the relation of husband and wife, and be bound to themselves,
to the state, and to society."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Verily this is individualism
absolutely unrestrained! It is the simple truth,
as already suggested, that in principle the canon law as it
existed in Catholic lands before the Council of Trent, and in
England until the marriage act of 1753, with a possibility
of all of its attendant scandals and hardships, still survives
in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> The apology of the Middle Ages was
found in the sacramental dogma. Matrimony as such, under
whatever conditions contracted, was too "holy" to be dissolved
or effectively hindered for the ordinary prudential
reasons which appeal to the statesman or legislator. Today
there is doubtless a lingering tradition of the same false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sentiment. Yet the common-law marriage is now supported
on two principal grounds. The innocent offspring, we are
told, ought not to suffer because the parents have neglected
the formalities prescribed by a mere statute. Moreover, to
declare an irregular, perhaps a clandestine, union void is to
invade the most sacred right of the individual. There is
urgent need that the American people should realize the
fallacy of such arguments. Far better that the children of
a delinquent minority should bear the stain of illegitimacy
than that the welfare of the whole social body should be
endangered. For the same reason the supposed right of the
individual must yield to the higher claims of society. In no
part of the whole range of human activity is there such
imperative need of state interference and control as in the
sphere of the matrimonial relations. In this field as in
others we are beginning to see more clearly that the highest
individual liberty can be secured only when it is subordinated
to the highest social good. It is, however, not merely
the public which suffers. "Our common-law marriage fails
to protect not only the contracting parties, but also the
families to which they belong. Indeed to protect the latter
it makes not the least attempt, and in this respect it is far
behind the law of Western Europe."<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> As a preliminary to
a general reform of our marriage laws as a whole it is earnestly
to be desired that every state or territory not already
emancipated should enact a statute as clear and decisive as
that of Kentucky, Utah, or New York, absolutely repudiating
the common-law contract. It is only through legislation
that this revolution can be effected. It is not the proper
function of the courts to attempt it. It may be that those
states which have superseded the common law through judicial
interpretation of their statutes have done well. The
end has perhaps justified the means. It is quite possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that in those cases it was the intent of the lawmaker to
render the statute mandatory. Nevertheless he did not
express his intent in the form which has itself become a
part of the common law. Chief Justice Parsons and his
followers may have been enforcing a "higher law;" but it
was a "judge-made" law. History is on the side of Chief
Justice Kent and the great number of jurists who have followed
him. Moreover, it is evident from the trend of recent
decisions that not much more can be expected from the
courts. According to the overwhelming weight of juridical
opinion, to go farther in this way would be to legislate consciously
through the bench. Besides "bench-made" law is
always <i>ex post facto</i>. The only practical course is to create
or further develop a sound popular sentiment in favor of
proper social control of the marital relation; and then to
express that sentiment in statutes whose terms are mandatory
beyond the possibility of evasion.</p>

<p><i>b</i>) <i>Resulting character of matrimonial legislation.</i>&mdash;The
absurd and demoralizing conflict between common-law
validity and statutory legality ought first to be abolished,
because in large measure it hinders, even frustrates, the
effort to develop a thorough and uniform system of matrimonial
administration in the United States. This once
effected, there will remain plenty of hard work to do. If we
consider the details of our legislation, as already analyzed
in the sixteenth chapter, we perceive in nearly every department
urgent need of reform, often of radical innovation.
Almost everywhere there is a want of clearness, certainty,
and simplicity; and this defect is all the more harmful because
of the lack of uniformity among the different states.
Diversity, even conflict, in every branch of state legislation
is a burdensome incident of the federal system; and in no
branch is the evil more formidable than in the field of marriage
and divorce. As hereafter suggested, we need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
despair of eventually overcoming it; but from the very
nature of the case it may be many years before an effective
remedy can generally be applied. In the meantime it is all
the more necessary that the laws of each individual state
should be made as clear, simple, and efficient as possible,
and that every opportunity should be seized to prepare the
way for a common matrimonial code for the whole country.</p>

<p>First of all, the statutes relating to the preliminaries of
marriage ought to be overhauled. Already during the past
century progress has been made. Within the last two
decades in particular many reforms in matters of detail have
been carried out in various states. Furthermore, in the
broad features or outlines of the law throughout the country
an approximation to a uniform system has been attained; and
this fact may be of great significance when the task of securing
absolutely the same law for all the states is earnestly
taken in hand. Thus there is practical agreement among
the states and territories in requiring a license from a local
civil officer before a marriage may be legally celebrated.
The dual system of banns or license survives only in Maryland,
Georgia, Delaware, and Ohio. All the other states and
territories, except Alaska, New Mexico, and South Carolina,
where there is no statute governing the subject, with New York
and New Jersey, where there is a substitute plan, have each
adopted a system of civil license or certificate, the same in its
purpose, though varying widely in the forms and procedure
prescribed. This is a stride in the direction at once of simplicity
and harmony; and besides, for its own sake, it is well
to get rid of the ancient device of oral banns, which has
proved as unsatisfactory in America as in the Old World.
Again, we have developed substantially a common statutory
law regarding the manner of entering into the marital relation.
Everywhere, except in Maryland and West Virginia,
where a religious ceremony is essential to a valid union, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
optional civil or religions ceremony, at the pleasure of the
persons contracting, is sanctioned by the law. As already
seen, this dual system has its roots planted deeply in the
history of two centuries. It is clearly entitled to be
regarded as the American plan; although since 1836, with
important modifications, it has also been accepted in the
British Isles. It does not follow, however, that it is the
ideal plan. It is too complex; and it is an obstacle in the
way of developing the most efficient system of matrimonial
administration. It is inconsistent with a proper social control.
It will prevent the attainment of the "maximum of
simplicity and the maximum of certainty" in matrimonial
legislation. It is awkward, thoroughly illogical, to intrust
the execution of that part of the law on which publicity and
security so much depend to two different classes of persons:
the one consisting of civil officers created and wholly under
control of the state; the other in its origin, its personnel,
and its character completely beyond such control, and only
subject to administrative rules and restraints. With this
system it will be very difficult to establish a proper standard
of special fitness, of special knowledge, such as is highly
needful to exact from public servants intrusted with functions
of vast social importance. European peoples have reached
a wiser solution of the problem in prescribing in all cases
without exception, as the prerequisite of a valid marriage,
the obligatory celebration before an authorized civil officer,
leaving the wedded pair to decide, as wholly a private matter,
whether a religious ceremony shall be added.</p>

<p>It is, however, highly probable that the optional system
of celebration is too firmly grounded in popular sentiment
to be soon discarded. The practical reformer must perforce
content himself with striving to make it as effective as possible.
At present the law is very lax in providing proper
safeguards for the religious solemnization. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
place, the qualified minister should be authorized to act
only within the local district of his permanent residence, the
limits thereof to be defined by statute. By the early laws
of New England, as we have already seen, the clergyman's
functions were carefully confined to his own town, district,
or county; and similar requirements appear elsewhere in
some of the older statutes. This wise policy has been gradually
abandoned, so that now in no instance is there such a
restriction. Only in a very few cases, as in Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Vermont, is authority conferred only
upon ministers dwelling within the state. Apparently in
the great majority of states and territories, although the
statutes are often far from clear, all qualified ministers, residing
anywhere in the United States, may act. Indeed,
Louisiana is still more generous, granting full privilege to
celebrate wedlock to any clergyman or priest "whether a
citizen of the United States or not." Another useful lesson
may be learned from the early laws. Proofs of ordination
by the filing of credentials were often demanded. Some of
the southern states went farther, exacting from the minister
a bond for the faithful performance of his trust, in addition
to credentials of ordination and good standing. Both these
conditions are still enforced by the statutes of Kentucky,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
Virginia, and West Virginia. Some other states have contented
themselves with less severe requirements. Rhode
Island has thus a careful system of local registration; in
Maine and New Hampshire the clerical celebrant must secure
a "commission" from the governor; in Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Nevada, and Arkansas he must file his credentials with
the proper county officer and receive a certificate; Ohio requires
a license from the county judge of probate; a license
from the proper authority is also demanded in Hawaii;<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in the majority of cases no such precautions are specified
in the statutes. Here is need of reform. Under present
social conditions, and considering the vast multiplication
and subdivision of religious sects, the Virginia system is not
too rigorous to justify its adoption throughout the land.
Furthermore, the future lawmaker may perhaps get a suggestion
from English legislation, which has had to deal with
the same problem. The ministers of every religious sect
are authorized to celebrate marriages according to its own
rites; but, aside from Jews, Quakers, and the Church of
England, otherwise provided for in the statute, they may do
so only in a "registered building" and in the presence of
the civil registrar of the district and two witnesses.</p>

<p>The laws regarding the civil ceremony are also seriously
defective, if not in all respects equally lax. The magistrate
in the exercise of his functions is not usually restricted to a
local district sufficiently small to guarantee safe administration.
In this regard the colonial and early state legislation
was superior. At present in twenty-two states and territories
the justice of the peace, or the corresponding local
officer, is confined to his own county or district. Elsewhere
he may act anywhere within the commonwealth; and this is
almost universally the rule with the higher judges and officials
who are granted the same authority. In no case,
except in Virginia, and in Massachusetts under the act of
1899, is there any provision for the appointment of a
person to celebrate wedlock for an area of less extent
than the county. Nor are the persons to whom is confided
this important social trust possessed of the needful
qualifications. They are not selected because of special fitness.
In no instance, unless in Virginia, does the law provide
for the separate office of marriage celebrant. The
duties of such a post are conferred, <i>ex officio</i>, in a haphazard
fashion, upon a great variety of functionaries, who are either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
incompetent or else too busy with other matters to discharge
them properly. As a rule, the justice of the peace is thus
notoriously unfit; and there is something grotesque in giving
authority to solemnize marriages to aldermen and police
justices, as in New York; to speakers of the house and
senate, as in Tennessee; or to the county supervisors, as in
Mississippi. In this regard we have much to learn from
European states, some of which have created special local
officers for this branch of administration. Thus in France<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
all marriages are regularly celebrated before the mayor of
the commune; in Germany,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> before the registrar of the district
in which one of the betrothed persons resides, or before
some civil officer designated by him in writing; while in
England the legal celebrant in case of civil procedure is also
the district registrar, whose presence is likewise requisite at
the religious ceremony when conducted according to the
rites of the nonconformist sects. Massachusetts alone has
taken a step in the right direction. The act of 1899, already
summarized, not only provides that no justice of the
peace&mdash;except when the holder of a specified clerical office&mdash;shall
solemnize marriage unless specially designated
therefor by the governor's certificate, but it also limits the
number of justices who may be thus licensed. Touching
another point in this connection the American lawmaker is
at fault. Often there is no direct provision to secure evidence
of the contract. Only nineteen of the fifty-three<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> states
and territories expressly require the presence at the ceremony
of even one witness; while in two or three other cases
the statute appears to take their presence for granted.</p>

<p>The license system is uncertain and complex in many of
its features. To guard against the clandestine marriage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
minors, an affidavit from either the bride or bridegroom
ought to be made obligatory in all cases, instead of leaving
its requirement to the discretion of the officer, as is now
usually the practice where there is any provision at all
regarding the matter. In several instances the age below
which parental consent is required is still too low; and the
laws of some states are entirely silent on the subject.
Throughout the country the limit for each sex ought to
coincide with the attainment of legal majority.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> More care
should be taken to prevent deception when consent of parent
or guardian is produced in writing. At the very least, in
harmony with the requirement of many states, the affidavit
of one witness to the signature should always be made obligatory;
and in every such case it might be well as a guaranty
to exact a license bond.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> There is a still graver fault
in the license laws of nearly the whole country. Nowhere,
except in Porto Rico, is there any adequate provision regarding
notice or the filing and trial of objections to a proposed
marriage. Maine and Wisconsin have each made a start in
requiring the certificate or license to be procured five days
before the celebration. No other state, except New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Hampshire<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and New Jersey in the case of non-residents, seems to
have provided for such a delay; and in all cases apparently,
except Porto Rico, the license is issued at the time the
notice of intention to marry is filed.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> All this is contrary
to sound public policy. The notice of intention should be
recorded for a reasonable period, say ten days, before
issuance of the license; and during this term it should
be officially posted, and also published in the newspapers&mdash;not
merely concealed in the register or published at the
discretion of the official, as is now the usual course. Objections
might then be filed, and in case of need tried in
a court clothed with proper jurisdiction, before the celebration
were allowed to proceed. Under the existing state
legislation it would be difficult, certainly awkward, to stop a
proposed marriage on the ground of alleged legal impediments.
To make an objection effective, it might be necessary
either to "anticipate the notice" or to interrupt the
nuptial ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> There is also much confusion, and
uncertainty regarding the place of obtaining the license and
that of making return. In no instance is a definite term of
residence for either the man or the woman prescribed; and
this is a fruitful source of clandestine marriage.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> A glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at the facts collected in the sixteenth chapter will show that
in some states the license must be secured in the place of the
bride's residence; in others, in that of the marriage; while
in a third group it may be issued in the place where either
dwells. Indeed, Pennsylvania, more liberal still, allows a
choice among all three places. The same laxity exists
regarding the place of return; and sometimes the place of
return is not the same as that of issue. A reasonable term
of residence ought always to be required; and, unless in
cases of emergency, the license should be issued by, and
return made to, the same official in the district where the
woman dwells. Even the lack of uniformity in license fees
is sometimes the cause of migration to neighboring districts
for the sake of cheaper weddings.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Finally, a marriage
entered into without license, just as without authorized celebration,
should be declared null and void by the statute.</p>

<p>During the last fifteen years considerable progress has
been made in the state systems of registration; but in most
cases the laws are still exceedingly lax; and too frequently
they are badly executed, or remain a "dead letter" on the
statute book.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>The radical reform of the administrative division of our
matrimonial laws on some such lines as those suggested will
be a worthy task for the future legislator. As a necessary
antecedent of more detailed action the official system should
be entirely reconstructed. The simplest mechanism is likely
to prove the best. Its elements are close at hand in the
local constitution. Every county should be divided into districts,
for each of which a registrar should be authorized to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
license, solemnize, and register all marriages civilly contracted
therein;<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> and to license, register, and attend religious
celebrations. His authority should be carefully restricted
to the district and no other person should be permitted to
share his functions. The district registrars should report at
short intervals to the county registrar, who in turn should
annually submit a summary of statistics to the registrar-general
for the state, by whom the local registrars should be
commissioned. If desirable for the sake of economy, especially
in states of sparse population, the collection and registry
of all vital statistics might be intrusted to the same
series of officials.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> The moral influence of the creation of
a distinct system, such as that outlined, would itself be of
great value. It would effectively accent the high relative
importance to society of matrimonial law and of intelligent
service in its administration.</p>

<p>Aside from its public features, just considered, the future
matrimonial code of the United States will have to remedy
numerous defects in the substance of the law. These may
be seen by reference to the detailed examination elsewhere
presented. In particular, it will be necessary to get rid of
the appalling chaos of state regulations regarding void and
voidable contracts. The absurd conflicts touching the forbidden
degrees of relationship are a positive social menace.
The most serious complications may arise. For instance, a
man and a woman who may be legally wed in the place
where they dwell might, should they move a mile across the
state line and then marry, be guilty of incestuous union and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
their children become bastards. Surely it ought to be possible
for an enlightened people to agree upon a common rule
in a matter of such vital concern.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>In many of the states the laws governing the "age of
consent"&mdash;that is, the age below which a person may not
legally consent to carnal union<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>&mdash;are still very defective,
although distinct progress has been made since 1885. In
that year Mr. W. T. Stead's exposure of the frightful traffic
in young girls then tolerated in London aroused the social
conscience on both sides of the sea. The "old common
law period of ten, sometimes twelve, years" was then "the
basis of the age of consent legislation of most of the states,
and also of the law of congress pertaining to rape in the
District of Columbia and other territory under the immediate
jurisdiction of the national government.... It was
not until after the astounding revelations made by Mr.
Stead ... that the age of consent laws in the United
States began to attract attention.... Even then the age
of consent in England was thirteen years. One outcome
of Mr. Stead's shocking exposures was the speedy raising
of the age by the British parliament from thirteen to sixteen
years, Mr. Gladstone and others advocating eighteen." The
New York Committee for the Prevention of State Regulation
of Vice was already engaged in its long struggle to
"thwart the periodical efforts<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> made to introduce in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
York and other American cities the odious old-world system
of licensed and state-regulated vice; but its members were
quite unaware, until Mr. Stead's startling London revelations
suggested the inquiry here, that, by the age of consent
laws of New York and of most of the states, young girls of
ten years were made legally capable of consenting to their
own ruin, and that at that time in one state, Delaware, the
age was at the shockingly low period of seven years! Bad
as English law had been shown to be in its inadequate protection
of girlhood our own legal position ... was found
to be still worse. The New York committee, as soon as the
facts were known, inaugurated a campaign of petitions to
sundry state legislatures and to the congress of the United
States, asking that the age be raised to at least eighteen
years, and the work was also entered into earnestly and
effectively by the Woman's Christian Temperance Unions
and the White Cross societies."<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Under the leadership of
Helen H. Gardener, Frances E. Willard, and others, the
women of the country conducted a veritable "crusade" of
education against the existing state laws, which for zeal,
ability, and effective method may well serve as a model for
future united efforts in favor of social reforms. It was
pointed out as a notorious fact "that brothels and vice-factories
get their recruits from the ranks of childhood&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the ignorance which is unprotected by the law;" that
"children's lives are thus wrecked, and the state is burdened
with disease and vice and crime and insanity, which is
transmitted and retransmitted until its proportions appall
those who understand;" and that it is absurd to make the
legal age for consent to a valid marriage higher than that for
consent to prostitution. It was urged that the age of consent
ought to be advanced to that of legal majority; that
girls "have a right to legal protection of their persons,
which is more imperative by far than is the protection which
every state has recognized as a matter beyond controversy
when applied to a girl's property or her ability to make
contracts, deeds, and wills, or to her control of herself in
any matters which are of importance to her as an individual,
and to the state, because she is one of its citizens whose
future welfare is a matter of moment to the commonwealth;"
and that in respect to her person, as well as regarding property
or marriage, she should be protected even against her
own will.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> As a result of the campaign of 1895 alone the
age of consent was raised in no less than fifteen states and
territories; and in the outset it was significantly pointed out
that the "two states in which the age of legal protection for
girlhood has been raised to eighteen years are states in which
women vote&mdash;Wyoming, upon equal terms with men, and
Kansas, in municipal elections."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> A brief summary of the
laws of the states and territories regarding the subject under
consideration may now be presented.</p>

<p>Encouraging progress has been made in New England,
although, in comparison with some of the new commonwealths
of the West, the facts are not very creditable. By
the Rhode Island statute the age of consent is sixteen.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
New Hampshire it was raised from thirteen to sixteen in
1897;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> in Vermont, from fourteen to sixteen in 1898;<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> and
in Connecticut, from fourteen to sixteen in 1895, while in
1901 the maximum term of imprisonment for abusing a girl
under sixteen was increased from three to thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
The age limit was only ten in Maine until 1887. It was
then raised to thirteen, and in 1889 to fourteen years.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> In
Massachusetts likewise the disgracefully low age of ten
years for a girl was sanctioned by statute from 1852 until
1886, when thirteen was substituted. Two years later it
was increased to fourteen; and by an act of 1893 an offense
against a female under sixteen may be punished by imprisonment
for life or for any shorter term of years.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> The
results are even less satisfactory in the southern and southwestern
group of states. Florida now heads the list, but
with a rather inadequate penalty, the age of consent being
raised from sixteen to eighteen years in 1901.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Missouri in
1889 increased the age from twelve to fourteen, and in 1895
advanced it nominally to eighteen; but the provisions of
the law are such as practically to leave the limit of protection
at fourteen years.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Previous to 1895 in Arizona the
age of consent was fourteen. In that year it was raised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
eighteen; but unfortunately it was reduced to seventeen in
1899.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> In Arkansas<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> it was raised from twelve to sixteen
years in 1893; in Louisiana,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> from twelve to sixteen in

it has been sixteen since 1889; in Oklahoma<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> it was

from ten to fourteen in 1890, and to sixteen in 1898; in

but the statutes of the three states last named are so lax as
really to leave the age of consent at twelve in Tennessee and
at fourteen in Maryland and Oklahoma. Texas advanced
the limit from ten to twelve in 1891, and to fifteen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
1895;<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> South Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> from ten to fourteen, and Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
from twelve to fourteen, in 1896; West Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> from twelve

in 1895; Alabama,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> from ten to fourteen in 1897; while
fourteen is likewise the age in New Mexico<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> and possibly
also in Georgia;<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> but because of vicious clauses in their
statutes a girl is in fact only given effectual protection
below the age of ten in Alabama and North Carolina, and
by common law at the same age in Georgia. Twelve is the
limit in Kentucky;<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> and Mississippi<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> still retains the
shamefully low age of ten years.</p>

<p>The most enlightened legislation regarding the age of
consent is found among the states of the middle and western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
group. Kansas<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> in 1887, and Wyoming<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> in 1890, set a
good example by raising it to eighteen years. The same
limit was adopted by Nebraska,<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Colorado,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Idaho,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and New
York<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> in 1895; by Utah<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> in 1896; by Washington<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> in 1897;
and by North Dakota in 1903.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Until 1889 Delaware sanctioned
the barbarous age of seven years. It was then advanced
to fifteen, and in 1895 to eighteen, for both sexes;
but the penalties prescribed by the statute are far too lenient
to guarantee entire protection beyond the age of seven.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
Next come ten states and districts in which the age is actually
or nominally placed at sixteen years. Minnesota<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
1891, South Dakota<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> in 1893, Michigan,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Montana,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> and
Oregon<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> in 1895, Ohio<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> in 1896, and California<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> in 1897,
each advanced to this limit from fourteen. Sixteen is also
the age in Alaska.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> But in 1902 Ohio took a backward
step, so lowering the penalty for the offense as nearly to
destroy the force of her law. Pennsylvania<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> and New
Jersey<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> each raised the age from ten to sixteen in 1887;
but in Pennsylvania the girl must prove previous good
character, and in both states the penalties are too lax to
secure adequate protection beyond the age of ten. Since
1896 the age of consent has been fifteen in Iowa.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> In
Illinois<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> since 1887, Nevada<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> since 1889, Indiana<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
1893, Wisconsin<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> since 1895, and in Porto Rico by the code
of 1902,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> it is fourteen; while in Hawaii it is but ten years.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>It appears, then, although in many cases the statutes are
very imperfect, that of the fifty-three states and territories
twelve have actually or nominally advanced the age of consent
to eighteen; one to seventeen; twenty-two to sixteen;
two to fifteen; thirteen to fourteen; while two still retain
the low age of twelve and one that of ten years. It should
everywhere be raised to eighteen or twenty-one&mdash;the age of
legal majority for a woman in her business or political relations&mdash;by
a statute as rigorous as that of Idaho or Kansas.
A wide field for beneficent legislation therefore remains;
and, although morality "can not be legislated into a people,"
it is precisely by wise measures of this character that the
lawmaker can render powerful aid in the creation of an
environment favorable to moral and social progress.</p>

<p><i>c</i>) <i>Resulting character of divorce legislation.</i>&mdash;What has
just been said regarding the function of social legislation
applies with special force to the laws relating to divorce.
Here, as in the case of marriage, there is a wide sphere of
useful activity for the lawmaker. He cannot, it is true,
reach the root of the matter: the fundamental causes of
divorce which are planted deeply in the imperfections of the
social system&mdash;particularly in false sentiments regarding
marriage and the family&mdash;and which, as will presently appear,
can only be removed through more rational principles and
methods of education. He can, however, by carefully drawn
and uniform statutes render the external conditions&mdash;the
legal environment&mdash;favorable for the operation of the proper
remedy. In this sense it is possible to have "good divorce
laws," just as we may have good charity laws, good laws for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the check of contagious diseases, or good laws in any department
of remedial social legislation.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> So far as their ethical
content is concerned, good divorce laws, like any other, will
not lead, but must follow at some distance, the highest moral
sentiment of the community. They should, however, follow
as closely as practicable in order to secure the obedience of
all. In this field it is highly essential that the laws should
be simple, certain, and uniform. They should not from their
very nature become a dead letter, or even an encouragement
to domestic discord, by offering opportunity for evasion,
collusion, or lax interpretation. Statutes which are not in
good faith executed, like those of France under the old <i>régime</i>,
are always a fruitful source of social disorder. They tend to
destroy the reverence for law itself. In this respect the
divorce laws of many of the states are still defective, although
decided progress has been made during the last twenty years.
Within this period the foundation of what may some time
become a common and effective divorce code for the whole
Union has slowly been laid. Little by little, as the detailed
discussion already presented in the seventeenth chapter
reveals, more stringent provisions for notice have been made,
longer terms of previous residence for the plaintiff required,
and more satisfactory conditions of remarriage after the
decree prescribed; while some of the "omnibus" clauses in
the list of statutory causes have been repealed. Much of
the best of this work has been accomplished, it is but
just to record, through the activity of the National Divorce
Reform League and its successor, the National League for the
Protection of the Family, under the able guidance of its alert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and zealous corresponding secretary, Rev. Samuel Dike, of
Auburndale.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> By this league was suggested the compilation
of the elaborate report of Hon. Carroll D. Wright,
commissioner of labor, published in 1889; and this has
had a powerful influence for good, providing the body of
facts needful for the wise direction of legal reform. But
in many ways in various states lax legislation is still a
demoralizing social factor. Thus, until the statute of 1902
has perhaps put a stop to the traffic, Rhode Island was a
favorite resort of persons from New York who were able to
escape the marital bond through the institution of "fake
suits" for nonsupport. Reno, Nev., has continued to be the
Mecca of newly divorced people from California and elsewhere,
seeking to evade their own laws by flight to a place
where there are no legal obstacles to immediate remarriage.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Greenwich, Conn., sustains a similar relation to New York.
Sioux Falls, S. D.&mdash;to produce one more from the many
examples which might be mentioned&mdash;appears still to have
a flourishing "divorce colony;" yet it may be true, as
strongly urged, that the laws of this state, though liberal,
are honestly and strictly interpreted.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Nor must it be
inferred in such cases that those who seek relief in a foreign
jurisdiction are for that reason unworthy people. There are
sometimes wrongs committed under shelter of the marriage
bond so monstrous as to warrant any legal means of gaining
relief. Indeed, the evil of clandestine divorce in the United
States has been much exaggerated. "A vital question connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with divorce," declares Commissioner Wright in
1891, "relates to the real or supposed migration of parties
from one state to another for the purpose of seeking divorce.
The popular idea is that a great deal of migration takes
place for the purpose named. This idea is dispelled in some
degree by the statistics that are available upon this point,
and getting at the truth as nearly as possible, it is found
that but little less than 20 per cent, of all the couples in the
country were divorced in other states than those in which
they were married. But the ordinary migration of parties
for legitimate purposes, especially from the older to the newer
states, which in 1870 showed that 23+ per cent. of the
native born population, and for 1880 22+ per cent. of such
population were living in states other than the ones in which
they were born, would apparently reduce the percentage of
persons migrating for the purpose of divorce to a point even
less than that stated."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> In fact, for the reason assigned by
Mr. Wright, it seems highly probable that the number of
such persons must be placed at considerably less than 10 per
cent. of the whole number of persons divorced in the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Accordingly, it has been inferred that uniformity
of law throughout the country would do little to lower the
divorce rate. "The establishment of uniform laws," concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Mr. Dike, "is not the central point of the problem."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Furthermore, there is another important fact bearing on the
evil of clandestine divorce. In a number of cases arising in
various states the courts have declared null and void decrees
secured in jurisdictions where the plaintiffs were not <i>bona fide</i>
residents, even when they had dwelt in such jurisdictions for
the statutory term prescribed as a condition for obtaining a
divorce.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>To some extent the evil of lax administration of the
divorce laws is exaggerated by popular opinion. In the
main the courts are careful and conscientious in the trial of
suits. According to the report of Commissioner Wright, in
seventy counties scattered over twelve states but 67.8 per
cent. of the petitions for divorce were granted. From this
fact it is inferred that "judges exercise a reasonable care
before issuing a decree." For the counties investigated "it
is certain that in about 30 per cent. of the cases of petition
a decree has been denied. The number of cases involved is
sufficiently large and the localities sufficiently different to
lead one to the conclusion that the same state of affairs exists
throughout the country, and that our courts, instead of being
careless in the matter of granting decrees, weigh well the
causes alleged, and do not grant decrees unless the allegations
of the libellants are fairly sustained."<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Still, under
the laws as they exist there is plenty of opportunity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
abuse, even when the court is cautious. The service of
notice on the absent defendant through the mails or through
publication in the newspapers, allowed in many states, and
the fact that only in a few instances is there any provision
requiring the prosecuting attorney to resist an undefended
libel, afford occasions for fraud.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> Some of the usual statutory
causes of divorce, under the refinement of judicial
interpretation, seem virtually to invite divorce.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> This is to
some extent true of "nonsupport," "wilful absence," "desertion,"
and "gross neglect of duty;" while "cruelty" has
become almost an "omnibus clause." Under plea of "constructive
cruelty" or "mental anguish" the grievances
admitted as valid grounds for dissolution of wedlock are
often trivial or even absurd, although it is likely that they are
sometimes put forward as a shield or substitute for graver
wrongs which the plaintiff is reluctant to disclose.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The
general introduction of the decree <i>nisi</i>, giving opportunity
for reflection, might prove a wholesome correction of the
almost necessarily liberal policy of the courts in such cases.
Divorce suits are sometimes too hastily disposed of by the
judges because of the pressure of other litigation. The
creation of a limited number of special divorce courts in each
of the states might prove a remedy, if care were taken not to
so increase the cost of actions as virtually to discriminate
against the poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The appearance of the government report in 1889 revealed
for the first time something like the real facts regarding
divorce in the United States. In the entire country during
the period of twenty years (1867-86) covered by the report,
328,716 petitions for full or partial divorce were granted.
From 9,937 decrees in 1867, the number rose to 11,586 in
1871, 14,800 in 1876, 20,762 in 1881, and to 25,535 in 1886,
showing an increase in twenty years of 157 per cent., while
there was a gain in population of but 60 per cent. during
the same period. Comparing the last year with the first,
only four states in the Union&mdash;Delaware, Connecticut,
Maine, and Vermont&mdash;show a decrease in the divorce rate;
while, more fairly, comparing the fourth quinquennium with
the first, only the three states last named show such a
"decrease in their divorce movement."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Of the whole number
of divorces during the twenty years, 112,540 were
granted to the husband and 216,176 to the wife. Among
the principal causes, at each stage of the wedded life, only
for adultery were more decrees granted on the husband's
petition than on the wife's.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> "As regards the ratio of
divorces to marriages, six states report marriages fully
enough for a trustworthy comparison. Of these, Connecticut
has for the entire period a divorce to 11.32 marriages and
for the worst year, 1875, one to 8.81; Rhode Island gives
one to 11.11 for the period and one to 9.36 in 1884, closely
approaching that for the preceding years; Vermont one to
16.96 for the period and at its worst, in 1871, one to 13;
Massachusetts gives one to 31.28 for the period, its worst
being one to 22.54 in 1878; Ohio averages one to 20.65,
with an almost unvarying progress downward to one to 15.16<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in 1886;" and in the District of Columbia the rate for the
period is 31.28, while at the best it is 74.65 in 1868 and at
the worst 20.82 in 1877. "In some other states where marriages
are less fully reported, the ratios are as follows:
Illinois one to 14.76 for the period, while Cook county gives
one to 13.6; Michigan one to 12.92; Minnesota one to 30.05;
New Hampshire one to 9.74 (its lowest, one to 7.6 in 1880,
being evidently due to very imperfect returns of marriages);
New Jersey shows one to 49.39; Kansas one to 17.42; Wisconsin
one to 21.07; and Delaware one to 36.99. These
last, it should be noted, are some of them for shorter periods
than twenty years."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> This method of comparing the number
of divorces granted with the number of marriages celebrated
is not very satisfactory. "It is vicious in this, that
the marriages celebrated each year cannot be compared
scientifically with the divorces drawn from the whole volume
of marriages celebrated in the past thirty or forty years,
many of which even took place in foreign countries."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> The
commissioner has therefore adopted another method of comparison,
not entirely free from error, based on the estimated
number of existing married couples. From this it appears
that in 1870, for the entire country, there were 664 married
couples to one divorce granted, while in 1880 the number of
such couples to one decree had fallen to 481.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Estimated
another way, on the basis of the eleventh census, in 1867
there were 173 divorces to 100,000 couples and 250 in 1886.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>The divorce rate in the United States is higher than in
any other country for which statistics are collected and
published, with the single exception of Japan,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> being lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in the southeastern and highest in the western and southwestern
states.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> As in Europe the divorce rate is higher
and the marriage rate lower in the cities than in the country.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
Again, while the marriage rate per capita of population is
steadily descending, the divorce rate is on the average rising,
although the "North Atlantic group of states, from Maine to
Pennsylvania inclusive, shows no increase" in the twenty
years, the growth of divorce just keeping pace "with the
population."<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> For some of the western states the more
recent statistics are sufficiently startling. "Divorces in Ohio
increased from 2,270 in 1889 to 3,217 in 1899, and the ratio
to marriages has become 1 to 10.9. There were 2,418
divorces in Michigan in the year 1900, or 1 to 9.6 marriages.
Here about two-thirds of the applications are granted. In
some states three-fourths of the suits are successful. In
Michigan the statistics show that nearly all the divorces are
granted to residents of the state. Indiana shows a remarkable
change for the worse. Almost a generation ago Indiana was
notoriously bad. Then the laws were improved and her
divorce rate was no worse than that of some states in the
east; but for some unexplained reason divorces of late have
increased rapidly. In 1899 there were granted no less than
4,031 divorces, and 4,699 in the year 1900. In the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
year the ratio of divorces to marriages of the same year
became 1 to 5.7 for the entire state," and 1 to 3.8 in the
county of Marion containing Indianapolis.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> In Europe likewise
the marriage rate is decreasing and the divorce rate
increasing, each in some countries with even greater rapidity
than on the average in the United States. Moreover, the
growth of divorce in recent years is a remarkable phenomenon
in Catholic as well as Protestant lands. Thus in the
entire German Empire divorces rose from 5,342 in 1882 to
6,677 in 1891, the population during the same decade rising
from 45,719,000 to 49,767,000. In Holland there were
together 271 divorces and separations in 1883 and 474 in
1892, the population at the same time advancing from
4,225,065 to 4,669,576. During the same ten years divorces
in Sweden rose from 218 to 316, the population being
4,603,595 at the beginning and 4,806,865 at the end of the
period. In this decade, the population making but slight
advance, the aggregate number of divorces and separations
in Switzerland decreased from 1,013 to 953. In France for
each 1,000 marriages celebrated 14 divorces were decreed in
1885 and 24 in 1891, the population showing a very small
increase. For the decennium beginning in 1884 and closing
in 1893 the number of divorces decreed in Belgium mounted
from 221 to 497, while the population grew from 5,784,958
to 6,262,272. During the same period in Greece the number
rose from 88 to 103. In Bavaria&mdash;like Greece or
Belgium a Catholic state&mdash;there is also a rapid growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
divorce, the number of decrees advancing from 218 in 1882
to 308 in 1891, thus giving a rate of one divorce for 24,490
of the population at the commencement as compared with
18,279 at the close of the decade.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> "In England divorces
rose from 127 in 1860 to 390 in 1887, an increase much
more rapid than that of population or of marriages. Judicial
separations rose between the same years from 11 to 50.
In Scotland divorces which in 1867 numbered 32 had, in
1886, grown to 96, a still more rapid rise, as it covers only
twenty instead of twenty-seven years. It is worth noting
that in England it is usually the husband who petitions for
a divorce, and almost always the wife who seeks a judicial
separation."<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>



<p>It has long been observed that in Europe the marriage
rate falls in hard times and rises again on the return of prosperity.
"According to all experience," declares Mill, "a
great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages
in seasons of cheap food and full employment."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The
middle and upper classes, says Fawcett, "do not often marry
unless they have reasonable prospect of being able to bring
up a family in a state of social comfort.... But the
laborers, who form the majority of the population, are but
slightly influenced by such cautious foresight. Even a trifling
temporary improvement in their material prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
acts as a powerful impulse to induce them to marry; for it
is a demonstrated statistical fact that the number of marriages
invariably increases with the decline in the price of
bread."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Farr and Bodio reach the same conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Ogle
on the other hand, while agreeing entirely with these writers
as to the favoring influence of prosperity and the depressing
effect of hard times on the number of marriages, finds in
England, so far as the price of bread alone is concerned, that
the reverse is true, more marriages there taking place among
the laboring class when bread is dear. In this case, he
urges, the higher cost of bread may itself be an incident of
increased industrial activity, depending in part on the rise
of freight charges on imported wheat. So he concludes that
"the marriage rate rises and falls with the amount of industrial
employment, which in its turn is determined by the
briskness of trade, as measured by the values of exports,
which also rise and fall concomitantly, and produce by their
effect upon freights a simultaneous rise or fall in the price
of wheat."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The researches of Oettingen, Bertillon, and
especially those of Cauderlier, have also disclosed a general
variation in the marriage rate corresponding with the rise or
fall in the price of the necessaries of life.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> War in particular
has a powerful influence in lowering the marriage rate,
while on the restoration of peace the loss may be largely or
entirely recovered. "In 1864 Denmark was at war with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Prussia, and its marriage rate fell from 15.0 to 11.13" for
each 1,000 inhabitants, "the lowest point it has ever yet
reached, but in the next year, the war being over, rose to
17.8, and was higher than it has ever been again. In 1866
Austria was at war with Prussia, and, while the Prussian
rate fell from 18.2 to 15.6, the Austrian rate fell from 15.5
to 13.0, but on the cessation of hostilities rose in 1867 to
19.3, a higher level than in any earlier year."<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> According
to Willcox,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> the same rule appears to hold good in the
United States. In Massachusetts for the period 1850-90
the marriage rate was low in the years of industrial depression
and during the Civil War. Furthermore, the same
writer has for the first time demonstrated that the average
divorce rate for the whole country is affected in the same
way, sinking in hard times and rising again on the restoration
of business. Represented graphically, the curve for
the Massachusetts marriages and the curve for United States
divorces (1867-86), with slight exceptions, "uniformly ascend
and descend together and reach their maxima and minima
in the same years. Depressions in trade have had a tendency
to decrease divorces as well as marriages;" whereas
in England, while the marriage rate falls the divorce rate
rises in hard times. But in that country divorce is notoriously
very expensive and hence mainly a luxury for the rich.
So it is concluded that "this difference between the effect of
hard times in England and in the United States, together
with the very rapid increase of divorce among the southern
negroes, and the fact that only about one wife in six of those
obtaining divorces receives any alimony, are among the indications
that divorce has become very frequent and perhaps
most frequent among our lower middle classes, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
reached for weal or woe a lower stratum than perhaps anywhere
in Europe."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>Whether the number of divorces is directly influenced
by legislation is a question which has given rise to decided
difference of opinion. Bertillon, writing in 1883 in favor of
the new divorce law of France then under consideration, took
the position that statutes extending the number of causes of
divorce or relaxing the procedure in divorce suits have little
influence "upon the increase in the number of decrees."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
Yet, for obvious reasons, he predicted that the first, though
not the lasting, result of a change in the law allowing absolute
divorce instead of mere separation would be the opposite
of this conclusion. Such, in fact, was the case. In 1883
there were 3,010 separations; while, after the new code took
effect, 4,478 divorces and separations were granted in 1884,
6,245 in 1885, and 6,211 in the following year.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> Only a
part of this can be accounted for by the change in law, for
there had been a rapid increase during the preceding fifty
years.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> For the United States this point has been examined
by Professor Willcox, and his results go to show that the
difference in the divorce rate existing among the states cannot
very largely be accounted for by the difference in the
number of grounds of petition sanctioned by the respective
statutes. Thus in 1880 New York admitted one cause, New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Jersey two causes, and Pennsylvania four; yet on the average
in that year for each 100,000 married couples New York was
granting 81 divorces, New Jersey 68, and Pennsylvania 111.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
"This means that more divorces for adultery are granted in
New York, relatively to population, than for adultery and
desertion in New Jersey, and almost as many as for adultery,
desertion, cruelty, and imprisonment in Pennsylvania. Assume
the number of married couples in the three states in
1875 to be a mean between the estimates for 1870 and 1880,
and compare with this mean the total number of divorces for
adultery in the three states for the twenty years. Pennsylvania
had annually 16 such divorces to 100,000 couples,
New Jersey had 26, and New York 78. Judging from the
court records, one would say that adultery was about three
times as frequent in New York as in New Jersey, and about
five times as frequent as in Pennsylvania. No such inference
is warranted. The true conclusion is that limiting the
causes increases the number of divorces in those which
remain, but without materially affecting the total number.
A certain proportion of the married couples in the three
states desired divorce, and was willing to offer the evidence
required in order to obtain the decree. The number of
causes, then, seems to have affected the grounds urged for
divorce, but in no large degree the total number."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> It is
possible that this conclusion is somewhat too emphatic. The
problem is very complex, and it is hard to make allowance
for all its conditions. For example, it should not be forgotten
that New Jersey has but one tribunal, the court of
chancery, authorized to grant divorce, whereas New York
has many; and if states sanctioning a wider range of causes
were selected for comparison, the result might be changed,
though scarcely to any wide extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Commissioner Wright has attempted to discover the
general influence of legislation by examining every change
in the laws during twenty years in connection with the
divorce statistics. Often a sudden increase, and occasionally
a slight decrease, in the rate is observed without any alteration
in the statutes. In fourteen instances, however, he
believes it "quite apparent that the lines of statistics are
curved in accordance with laws enacted just previous to the
curves."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The changes effected by these laws are of many
kinds, including the addition and repeal of causes and various
alterations in the procedure, some of them complex.
But under careful scrutiny in some instances the statistics
reveal no certain causal relation between the change in the
divorce rate and the antecedent change in the statute.
Indeed, in the light of Professor Willcox's detailed criticism
of the figures, four of Mr. Wright's test cases must be rejected,
so far as evidence afforded by the statistics is concerned;<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
four or five others show considerable influence of
legislation; while in the rest that influence is slight, temporary,
or questionable.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Contrary to the popular opinion,
restrictions upon the remarriage of divorced persons would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
not affect in a large degree the divorce rate, although only
foreign statistics are available to test the point. These show
that within the first two or three years after dissolution of
marriage divorced men are not much more inclined to remarry
than are widowers, while during the same period a
considerably greater number of divorced women than widows
renew the nuptial ties.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> With an increasing rate, which does
not advance uniformly, it is perhaps impossible to measure
exactly the effects of lax or restrictive legislation. The
divorce movement is dependent upon social forces which lie
far beyond the reach of the statute-maker. Yet it seems
almost certain that there is a margin, very important though
narrow, within which he may wisely exert a restraining influence.
Good laws may, at any rate, check hasty impulse and
force individuals to take proper time for reflection. They
may also by securing publicity prevent manifold injustice in
the granting of decrees.</p>

<p>After all, in this fact do we not catch a glimpse of the
proper sphere of divorce legislation? Divorce is a remedy
and not the disease. It is not a virtue in a divorce law, as
appears to be often assumed, to restrict the application of
the remedy at all hazards, regardless of the sufferings of the
social body. If it were always the essential purpose of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
good law to diminish directly the number of <i>bona fide</i>
divorces, the more rational course would be to imitate South
Carolina and prohibit divorce entirely. Divorce is not
immoral. It is quite probable, on the contrary, that drastic,
like negligent, legislation is sometimes immoral. It is not
necessarily a merit, and it may be a grave social wrong, to
reduce the legal causes for a decree to the one "scriptural"
ground. The most enlightened judgment of the age heartily
approves of the policy of some states in extending the causes
so as to include intoxication from the habitual use of strong
drinks or narcotics as being equally destructive of connubial
happiness and family well-being. Indeed, considering the
needs of each particular society, the promotion of happiness
is the only safe criterion to guide the lawmaker in either
widening or narrowing the door of escape from the marriage
bond. The divorce movement is a portentous and almost
universal incident of modern civilization. Doubtless it signifies
underlying social evils vast and perilous. Yet to the
student of history it is perfectly clear that this is but a part
of the mighty movement for social liberation which has been
gaining in volume and strength ever since the Reformation.
According to the sixteenth-century reformer, divorce is the
"medicine" for the disease of marriage. It is so today in a
sense more real than Smith or Bullinger ever dreamed of;
for the principal fountain of divorce is bad matrimonial laws
and bad marriages. Certain it is that one rises from a
detailed study of American legislation with the conviction
that, faulty as are our divorce laws, our marriage laws are
far worse; while our apathy, our carelessness and levity,
regarding the safeguards of the matrimonial institution are
well-nigh incredible. Indeed, there has been a great deal
of misdirected and hasty criticism of American divorce legislation.
Even thoughtful scholars sometimes indulge in the
traditional arraignment. The laws of the American states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
produced since 1789, declares Bryce, present "the largest
and the strangest, and perhaps the saddest, body of legislative
experiments in the sphere of family law which free self-governing
communities have ever tried."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Such sweeping
assertions are in many ways misleading and fail to advance
the solution of the divorce problem. There is, of course,
in the aggregate a "large" body of statutes; for each of the
fifty-three commonwealths, on this subject as on all others,
has a separate code; but the harm resulting either from the
bulk or the perplexity of the laws, while needing a remedy,
is not so serious as is commonly assumed. More and more
in their essential features the divorce laws of the states are
duplicating each other; and there is already ground for hope
that in reasonable time they may attain to practical uniformity.
Furthermore, it may well be questioned whether the
complexity or the conflict in the American codes is so pronounced
as in the numerous systems of divorce law maintained
in the states of the German Empire until the enactment
of the imperial code of 1900. In some cases in
German lands the law was obscure and well-nigh past finding
out. Prussia alone had three different systems; and
Bavaria was in the same plight.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> If American legislation is
on the average more liberal in extending the enumerated
grounds of divorce, it would surely be rash to assume that it
is the "sadder" on that account. The question is: Has
American social liberalism, in this regard as in so many
other respects, increased the sum of human happiness?
Besides, "laxity" in this connection is not exclusively a
feature of American legislation. It may be reasonably
doubted whether any "omnibus clause" in the country gives
wider discretion to the court than the fourth of the five
causes sanctioned by the new uniform law of Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
allowing divorce when "either spouse has been guilty of
grave violation of the obligations based on the marriage or
of so deeply disturbing the marital relation through dishonorable
or immoral behavior that the continuance of the
marriage cannot be expected from the other."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Even broader
provisions formerly existed in the codes of some of the separate
German states, and may still be found elsewhere in
Europe.</p>

<p>The achievement of a wisely conceived and carefully
drafted uniform law for the entire country, would be of great
advantage, although it might not directly cause a very great
decrease in the average divorce rate, and certainly would not
produce the same rate for the individual states.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> How may
such a uniform law be secured? The method of procuring
the enactment of a federal law under a constitutional amendment&mdash;once
much in favor<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>&mdash;has for the present been almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
abandoned by active workers. Instead, it is preferred,
through the state commissions on uniform legislation, to
urge the adoption of a model statute by the separate
commonwealths. These commissions, now thirty-five in
number, have prepared a bill for a law governing divorce
procedure; and its temperate and practical provisions ought
to gain its general adoption.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> All this is well; but it is still
more needful to strive for a common marriage law. In the
end it may be found necessary, under a constitutional amendment,
to appeal to the federal power. What service could a
national legislature render more beneficent than the creation
of a code embracing every division of the intricate law of
marriage and divorce? Aside from its educational value as
a moral force, such a code in material ways would prove a
powerful guaranty of social order and stability.</p>

<p>In the meantime it is essential to fix the attention upon
causes rather than effects. For the wise reformer, who would
elevate and protect the family, the center of the problem is
marriage and not divorce.</p>


<h4>II. THE FUNCTION OF EDUCATION</h4>

<p>It is needful in the outset, as already suggested, frankly
to accept marriage and the family as social institutions whose
problems must be studied in connection with the actual conditions
of modern social life. It is vain to appeal to ideals
born of old and very different conditions. The guiding light
will come, not from authority, but from a rational understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of the existing facts. Small progress can be
expected while leaning upon tradition. The appeal to theological
criteria is, no doubt, matter of conscience on the part
of many earnest men. Nevertheless the vast literature which
seeks to solve social questions through the juggling with
ancient texts seems in reality to be largely a monument of
wasted energy. Much of it is sterile, or but serves to retard
progress or to befog the issue. Witness the perennial discussion
of the "scriptural" grounds of divorce, or of the
Levitical sanction or condemnation of marriage with a deceased
wife's sister! Witness the vapid homilies and treatises
on the wedded life! There is, in truth, urgent need that the
moral leaders of men should preach actual instead of conventional
social righteousness. It is high time that the
family and its related institutions should be as freely and
openly and unsparingly subjected to scientific examination
as are the facts of modern political or industrial life.</p>

<p>From the infancy of the human race, we have already
seen, the monogamic family has been the <i>prevailing</i> type.
There have been, it is true, many variations, many aberrations,
from this type under diverse conditions, religious,
economic, or social. Under changing influences the interrelations
of the members of the group&mdash;of husband and wife,
of parent and child&mdash;and their relations individually and
collectively to the state, have varied from age to age or from
people to people. There have been wife-capture, wife-purchase
and the <i>patria potestas</i>. But in essential character&mdash;at
first for biological, later for ethical or spiritual
reasons&mdash;the general tendency has always been toward a
higher, more clearly differentiated type of the single pairing
family. Moreover, setting aside all question of special
priestly sanctions, the healthiest social sentiment has more
and more demanded that the "pairing" should be lasting.
Whether of Jew or gentile, the highest ideal of marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
has become that of a lifelong partnership. Are these tendencies
to remain unbroken? Is the stream of evolution to
proceed, gaining in purity and strength? Are marriage and
the family doomed; or are they capable of adaptation, of
reform and development, so as to satisfy the higher material
and ethical requirements of the advancing generations?
Seemingly they are now menaced by serious dangers. Some
of them have their origin in the new conditions of a society
which is undergoing a swift transition, a mighty transformation,
industrially, intellectually, and spiritually; while others,
perhaps the more imminent, are incident to the institutions
themselves as they have been shaped or warped by bad laws
and false sentiments. Apparently, if there is to be salvation,
it must come through the vitalizing, regenerative power
of a more efficient moral, physical, and social training of the
young. The home and the family must enter into the educational
curriculum. Before an adequate sociological program
can be devised the facts must be squarely faced and
honestly studied. In the sphere of domestic institutions, even
more imperatively than in that of politics or economics, there
is need of light and publicity.</p>

<p>The family, it is alleged, is in danger of disintegration
through the tendency to individualism which in many ways
is so striking a characteristic of the age.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Within the family
itself there are, indeed, signs that a rapid transition from
status to contract is taking place in a way which Maine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
scarcely contemplated; for he appears to have imagined that
precisely in this sphere the process was already virtually
complete. The bonds of paternal authority are becoming
looser and looser. In America in particular young men and
even young women earlier than elsewhere tend to cut their
parental moorings and to embark in independent business
careers. So also more and more clearly the wife is showing
a determination to escape entirely from <i>manu viri</i>&mdash;still
sustained by the relics of mediæval law and sentiment&mdash;and
to become in reality as well as in name an equal partner
under the nuptial contract. The state also has intervened to
abridge the parental authority. Minor children are no
longer looked upon as the absolute property of the father.
For the purpose of education, society removes them for a
considerable part of the period of nonage from home and
immediate parental control; and, on the other hand, it forbids
their employment in mines, factories, or other injurious
vocations during their tender years. Under child-saving
laws they may even be removed from home, when they are
cruelly treated or exposed to vicious influences, and placed
under the protection of the state. Thus, little by little, to
use the phrase of a thoughtful writer, the original "coercive"
powers of the family under the patriarchal <i>régime</i> have been
"extracted" and appropriated by society. In the education
of the young the family retains the lesser part. "The state
has here interfered in the private ordering of the household
by taking the child from its parents for one-third of its waking
hours, and has introduced order and system into the
training of children, together with the assertion of rights on
their part. The family becomes therefore less a coercive
institution, where the children serve their parents, and more
a spiritual and psychic association of parent and child based
on persuasion. A more searching interference on the part of
the state, together with a new set of governmental organizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
for its enforcement, is found in the boards of children's
guardians, the societies for the prevention of cruelty to
children, orphans' asylums, state public schools, with their
investigating and placing-out agents, empowered under
supervision of the courts to take children away from parents
and to place them in new homes. A large part of the
unlimited coercion of the <i>patria potestas</i> is here extracted
from the family and annexed to the peculiar coercive institution
where it is guided by notions of children's rights, and
all families are thereby toned up to a stronger emphasis on
persuasion as the justification of their continuance."<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Here
we catch a glimpse of the direction of future evolution in
the family. At the same time it appears that the disintegration
of paternal and marital coercive power is not a serious
menace to the family. It has cleared the way for a higher
and nobler spiritual domestic life. The real danger is that
the family and the home will surrender an undue share of
their duty and privilege to participate in the culture and
training of the young. This function for the good of society
may be vastly developed, though mainly on new lines bearing
directly on the nature of marriage and the family. Of
this function some further mention will presently be made.</p>

<p>More threatening to the solidarity of the family is believed
to be the individualistic tendencies arising in existing
urban and economic life.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> With the rise of corporate and
associated industry comes a weakening of the intimacy of
home ties. Through the division of labor the "family
hearth-stone" is fast becoming a mere temporary meeting-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of individual wage-earners. The congestion of population
in cities is forcing into being new and lower modes of
life. The tenement and the "sweating system" are destructive
of the home. Neither the lodging-house, the "flat,"
nor the "apartment" affords an ideal environment for
domestic joys. In the vast hives of Paris, London, or New
York even families of the relatively well-to-do have small
opportunity to flourish&mdash;for self-culture and self-enjoyment.
To the children of the slum the street is a perilous nursery.
For them squalor, disease, and sordid vice have supplanted
the traditional blessings of the family sanctuary. The
cramped, artificial, and transient associations of the boarding-house
are a wretched substitute for the privacy of the separate
household.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> For very many men club life has stronger
allurements than the connubial partnership. Prostitution
advances with alarming speed. For the poor, sometimes for
the rich, the great city has many interests and many places
more attractive than the home circle. The love of selfish
indulgence and the spirit of commercial greed, not less than
grinding penury, restrain men and women from wedlock.
Yet the urban environment has also the opposite effect. In
the crowded, heterogeneous, and shifting population of the
great towns marriages are often lightly made and as lightly
dissolved. Indeed, the remarkable mobility of the American
people, the habit of frequent migration, under the powerful
incentives of industrial enterprise, gold-hunting, or other
adventure, and under favor of the marvelously developed
means of swift transportation, will account in no small degree
for the laxity of matrimonial and family ties in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
States. May not one gather courage even from this untoward
circumstance? Assuredly the present thus clearly
appears to be an age of transition to a more stable condition
of social life. Furthermore, the perils to the family of the
kind under review need not be fatal. They are inherent
mainly in economic institutions which may be scientifically
studied and intelligently brought into harmony with the
requirements of the social order. Already in great municipal
centers, through improved facilities for rapid transit,
the evils resulting from dense population are being somewhat
ameliorated. Of a truth, every penny's reduction in street-railway
fares means for the family of small means a better
chance for pure air, sound health, and a separate home in
the suburbs. The dispersion of the city over a broader area
at once cheapens and raises the standard of living. Every
hour's reduction in the period of daily toil potentially gives
more leisure for building, adorning, and enjoying the home.</p>

<p>To the socialist the monogamic family in its present form
is decidedly a failure. "To those who would substitute
common ownership for industrial liberty, the institution of
the family presents one of the most persistent obstacles.
Domestic unity is inconsistent with the absolute social unity
vested in the state."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> The larger social body must be composed
of individual members, free and equal; and it will not
tolerate within itself a smaller body with special group-interests
of its own, much less with any vestige of coercive
authority over its constituent parts. There must be no
<i>imperium in imperio</i>. Writers like Engels<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> seek consolation
and support in Bachofen's theory of a universal stage of
mother-right before the monogamic family with the institution
of private property had brought domestic slavery into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the world. They "hold that the monogamic family is a
relic of decaying civilization. All ideas on which it rests,
the subordination and dependence of women, the ownership
of children, the belief in the sacredness of marriage as a
divine institution, above all respect for the individual ownership
of property and the rights of inheritance as permanent
elements in our social organization&mdash;have been undermined.
The foundations are sapped and the superstructure is ready
to topple in."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>Woman in particular has been the devoted victim of the
greed of individual possession upon which the monogamic
family rests. "Far back in history," according to Edward
Carpenter, "at a time when in the early societies the thought
of inequality had hardly arisen, it would appear that the
female, in her own way&mdash;as sole authenticator of birth and
parentage, as guardian of the household, as inventress of
agriculture and the peaceful arts, as priestess and prophetess
or sharer in the councils of the tribe&mdash;was as powerful as
man in his, and sometimes even more so. But from thence
down to today what centuries of repression, of slavehood, of
dumbness, of obscurity have been her lot!"<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Under socialism, declare Morris and Bax, marriage and
the family will be affected "firstly in economics and secondly
in ethics. The present marriage system is based on the
general supposition of economic dependence of the woman on
the man, and the consequent necessity of his making provision
for her." In the new social order this degrading condition
must disappear. "Property in children would cease
to exist, and every infant that came into the world would be
born into full citizenship, and would enjoy all its advantages,
whatever the conduct of its parents might be. Thus a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
development of the family would take place, on the basis, not
of a predominant life-long business arrangement, to be formally
and nominally held to, irrespective of circumstances,
but on mutual inclination and affection, an association terminable
at the will of either party." Thus a higher morality
would be sanctioned. There would be no "vestige of reprobation
for dissolving one tie and forming another."<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>A similar demand for liberty is made by Laurence Gronlund.
Economically "the coming commonwealth" will place
woman "on an equal footing with man." But she will be
"equal," not "alike;" for in the new society the sexes will
no longer be free industrial competitors, but each will have
its special vocation. Physiological differences will not be
ignored. "Woman will become a functionary, she will have
suitable employment given her, and be rewarded according
to results, just the same as men." Like men she will have
suffrage, not as a right or a privilege, but as a trust. "The
new order will necessarily, by the mere working of its economic
principles, considerably modify" the marriage relation;
and "is that relation such an ideal one now, that it
would be a sacrilege to touch it? Is marriage not now, at
bottom, an establishment for the support of woman? Is not
maintenance the price which the husband pays for the
appendage to himself? And because the supply generally
exceeds the demand&mdash;that is, the effective demand&mdash;has
woman not often to accept the offer of the first man who
seems able to perform this pecuniary obligation?" If it be
objected that this is taking "rather a commercial view" of
the "holy" relation, is not, "as a matter of fact, marriage
regarded by altogether too many as a commercial institution?
Do not, in fact, the total of young women form a matrimonial
market, regulated by demand and supply?" "Now the Co-operative
Commonwealth will dissipate this horror," enabling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
every healthy adult man and woman to find a mate. Thus,
contrary to false charges, socialists are not trying to destroy
the family: "they want to enable every man and woman to
form a happy family!" Modern democracy revolts against
the patriarchal constitution of the family, upon whose model
all feudal and ancient societies were organized. In the
"very nature of things family-supremacy will be absolutely
incompatible with an interdependent, a solidaric, commonwealth;
for in such a state the first object of education must
be to establish in the minds of the children an indissoluble
association between their individual happiness and the good
of all."<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>The manifold social evils which take their rise directly or
indirectly in marriage as it is&mdash;be the actual causes what
they may&mdash;have always justly aroused the unsparing criticism
of socialistic writers. Thus to Robert Owen&mdash;whose
pure life was unreservedly and courageously devoted to the
social good, as he understood it&mdash;marriage was a member of
his "trinity of causes of crime and immorality among mankind."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>
With almost the fanatical zeal of an apostle of a
new religion, he railed at the "single" family.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> He proclaimed
the glad tidings of the swift approach of the new
moral order. Then "the imaginative laws of the marriages
of the priesthood must be among the first to be abolished,
by reason of their extended injurious influence upon human
nature, poisoning all the sources of the most valuable qualities
which Nature has given to infant man. These marriages
have dried up the fountain of truth in human nature; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
perpetually insinuate that man can love and hate at his
pleasure, and that to be virtuous he must live according to
the dictates of the laws and ceremonies devised by the priesthood,
that he must hate according to the same dictation, and
that if he does not thus love and hate, he is vicious, and he
will be eternally punished in another world," while on earth
he will suffer from the human laws and by the public opinion
which priests have inspired.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Under the new moral order
all this will be changed. Marriages will be more lasting
than now. "Every individual will be trained and educated,
to have all his powers cultivated in the most superior manner
known; cultivated too under a new combination of external
objects, purposely formed, to bring into constant exercise
the best and most lovely qualities only of human nature."
Wealth for all will be "produced in superfluity." Therefore
all will be "equal in their education and condition," and
without any distinction except as to age. "There will be
then no motive or inducement for any parties to unite, except
from pure affection arising from the most unreserved knowledge
of each other's character.... There will be no artificial
obstacles in the way of permanent happy unions of the
sexes; for ... the affections will receive every aid which
can be devised to induce them to be permanent;" and the
wedded pair "will be placed as far as possible in the
condition of lovers during their lives." In "some partial
instances," however, happiness might not even thus be
secured. In such event, "without any severance of friendship
between the parties, a separation may be made, the least
injurious to them and the most beneficial to the interests of
society."<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> In fine, Robert Owen's book, although often
vague in expression and violent in tone, contains in its statements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and still more in its suggestions, practically the whole
program of later socialistic writings on the subject of marriage
and the family, except the argument based on historical
evolution.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>Robert Dale Owen followed in his father's footsteps. He
finds even the Haytian institution of "placement"&mdash;an informal
union made and dissolved at the pleasure of the contracting
persons&mdash;far superior in its morality and its stability
to the sacramental marriage which exists by its side.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>August Bebel, in his able book on <i>Woman and Socialism</i>,
draws a powerful indictment of matrimonial relations under
the existing order. To this source, in his view, may be
traced the prevalence of sexual crimes and the most dangerous
tendencies now threatening the integrity of society. Infanticide,
abortion, and prostitution; the decline in the birth
and marriage rates; the increase in the number of divorces;
the subjection of woman&mdash;all these, he says, are due mainly
to the influence of the present "coercive marriage." This is
so because that "marriage is an institution bound up in the
closest way with the existing social order and with it must
stand or fall." Coercive marriage is the creature of economic
conditions, the "normal marriage" of the present bourgeois
society; and with that society it is already in process of disruption.
"Since all these unnatural conditions, being especially
harmful to woman, are grounded in the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
bourgeois society and are growing with its duration, that society
is proving itself incapable of remedying the evil and
of emancipating woman. Another social order is therefore
needful for this purpose." In the new state, economically
and socially, woman will be entirely independent. She will
no longer be the subject of authority and of exploitation;
but, free and equal by man's side she will become "mistress
of her own destiny."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the remedy suggested
by socialistic writers, whether or not our only hope lies in
the co-operative commonwealth, it is certain that they have
rendered an important public service. They have earnestly
studied and set forth the actual facts. With unsparing
hand they have laid bare the flaws in our domestic institutions
as they really exist. They have clearly proved that
the problems of marriage and the family can be solved only
by grasping their relations to the economic system. They
have shown that progress lies along the line of the complete
emancipation of woman and the absolute equality of
the sexes in marriage. In accomplishing all this they
have in effect done much to arouse in the popular mind a
loftier ideal of wedded life.</p>

<p>The liberation of woman in every one of its aspects profoundly
involves the destiny of the family. It signifies in
all the larger activities of life the relative individualization
of one-half of human kind. This means, of course, a weakening
of the solidarity of the family group, so far as its cohesion
is dependent on the remnants of mediæval marital
authority. Will the ultimate dissolution of the family thus
become the price of equality and freedom? Or rather, is it
not almost certain that in the more salubrious air of freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and equality there is being evolved a higher type of the
family, knit together by ties&mdash;sexual, moral, and spiritual&mdash;far
more tenacious than those fostered by the régime of subjection?
How remarkable, in England as well as in America,
is the revolution already accomplished! Few facts in social
history are more instructive than the change which has
taken place in the tone of the literature dealing with woman
and her relations to marriage and the family. In the eighteenth
century and until far down into the nineteenth it is
for the most part utterly frivolous or sentimental. Vapid
satire abounds. Erotic or facetious verse at the expense of
the "fair sex" or "wedded love" finds ready popular response.
Even in what is meant for earnest discussion
woman is treated as a helpless being, to be petted, cajoled,
or corrected, not too harshly, by her superior lord; or else she
is edified with endless lectures on the sacred duty of guarding
her virtue&mdash;a fact which throws a lurid and unintentional
light on the moral standards of the age. Imagine an
<i>Essay on Old Maids</i>,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> tediously spun out in three volumes;
or a book like Eliza Haywood's <i>Female Spectator</i>,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
although in four volumes, had already reached its seventh
edition in 1771.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the beginning of an efficient agitation for
woman's rights was then made. As early as 1696 appeared
Mary Astell's vigorous <i>Defense of the Female Sex</i>, further
developing views which she had expressed two years
earlier.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> The next year Defoe, advocating an "academy for
women," made a strong plea for the equal education of the
sexes.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> A singularly clear and incisive exposure of the
<i>Hardships of the English Laws in relation to Wives</i> was
published in 1735. The writer, apparently a woman, while
protesting that her adversaries for want of arguments resort
to "points of wit, smart jests, and all-confounding laughter,"
presents many striking proofs from judicial annals and elsewhere
to show that in England the "estate of wives is more
disadvantageous than slavery itself;" that they "may be
made prisoners for life at the discretion of their domestick
governors;" and that they "have no property, neither in
their own persons, children, or fortunes."<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> In 1739 an
anonymous writer, signing herself "Sophia," produced a
forceful <i>Vindication of the natural Right of the Fair-Sex
to a perfect Equality of Power, Dignity, and Esteem with
the Men</i>, in which, appealing to "rectified reason," she
urged that difference in sex relates to the "propagation of
human nature," whereas in "soul there is no sex," and diversity
must therefore come from education and environment.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
Mary Wollstonecraft's better known and much more elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<i>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>,<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> published in
1792, was therefore not without helpful predecessors. But
it is immensely superior to them in its literary power and
its intellectual grasp. The fearless, direct, and unaffected
way in which the subject is handled, especially the questions
of sex and education, discloses the dawn of a new era of
discussion. More clearly than ever before the liberation of
woman appears as a sociological problem of the greatest
moment to mankind. True, much space is devoted to combating
objections which may now seem trivial; but to the
average mind of Mary Wollstonecraft's day they were by
no means trivial, and they had to be cleared away before the
full light could come in.</p>

<p>The foundations were thus laid upon which, chiefly during
the last half-century,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> a vast literary superstructure&mdash;controversial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
historical, and scientific&mdash;has been erected; a
many-sided literature worthily embodying the thought of a
great transitional stage in social progress. The opponents
of woman's liberation have been forced to choose new weapons.
Satire and mockery are no longer in vogue. Both
sides are very much in earnest. The tone of present discussion
is nothing if not serious. Moreover, while the
battle for sexual equality in the family and in the state is
very far from being yet fought out, the ultimate victory
seems already assured.</p>

<p>It would, indeed, be very strange if some incidental
harm should not result from the veritable revolution in the
condition of American women which little more than a generation
has produced. This is the inevitable penalty which
social progress has always to pay. Yet in the present case
the transitional loss to the family or to the larger social body
is exceedingly slight compared even with the immediate
gain. This is especially true of woman's new intellectual
life with all its manifold activities. It matters not whether
she is showing herself mentally man's equal. If any justification
of her new rôle were needed it might suffice to
affirm that she has precisely the same right as man to free
and unhampered self-development in whatever direction and
in whatever manner she herself shall find most conducive to
her happiness. But it is amply justified by its social results.
It cannot be seriously doubted that woman's admission
to equal privilege of higher education is enabling her
better to share with man in doing the world's work.
Besides, in spite of the vain imaginings of misogynistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
philosophers,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> the problem of special sexual function in its
relation to mental capacity is being settled in woman's favor.
"Science," declares Lourbet, in completing his valuable
survey, "is incapable of demonstrating the 'irremediable'
mental inferiority of woman.... The pretended antagonism
between mental power and sexual power, which does
not withstand rigorous analysis, appears definitively to be
destroyed by experience, by the tangible facts which incessantly
strike the eye."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Herbert Spencer reaches the conclusion
that "were liberties to be adjusted to abilities, the
adjustment, even could we make it, would have to be made
irrespective of sex."<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>It is singular what acute anxiety is felt by adherents of
the old régime<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> lest woman's new intellectual life should
prove disastrous to her physical constitution, unmindful of
the fact that even now for the majority of married women
the burdens of the orthodox "natural sphere" are far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
harmful. The tables are decidedly turned by a radical
writer who with truth declares that "evidence is rapidly
accumulating which makes it almost impossible to deny that
the feminine constitution has been disastrously injured
during the long ages of patriarchal rule, and that this beloved
'sphere' of woman, where she was thought so safe and
happy, has, in fact, been a very seed-bed of disease and
misery and wrong;" that "through these ages of overstrain
of every kind&mdash;physical, emotional, nervous&mdash;one set of
faculties being in perpetual activity while the others lay
dormant, woman has fallen into a state that is more or less
ailing and diseased; that upon her shoulders has been laid
the penalty of the injustice and selfishness of men."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Even
if the participation of woman in the mental activities and
the public vocations which men have hitherto monopolized
should prove harmful to her, has she not a right to discover
the fact by experience? "I consider it presumptuous," said
John Stuart Mill in the outset of the organized emancipation
movement, "in anyone to pretend to decide what women
are or are not, can or cannot be by natural constitution.
They have always hitherto been kept, as far as regards
spontaneous development, in so unnatural a state that their
nature cannot but have been greatly distorted and disguised,
and no one can safely pronounce that if woman's nature
were left to choose its direction as freely as men's, and if no
artificial bent were attempted to be given to it except that
required by the conditions of human society, and given to
both sexes alike, there would be any material difference, or
perhaps any difference at all, in the character and capacities
which would unfold themselves."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>It is vain for "scientific optimism" to seek in "nature"
a justification for woman's sexual subjection. "Independently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
... of its false facts and false premises, this pretended
scientific defense of the undue inequality of the
sexes in man is fundamentally unsound in resting upon a
thoroughly false assumption, which is only the more pernicious
because widely prevalent. It assumes that whatever
exists in nature must be the best possible state.... The
only practical use to which we put science is to <i>improve upon
nature</i>, to control all classes of forces, social forces included,
to the end of bettering the conditions under which we inhabit
the earth. This is true civilization, and all of it."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>The fear that the education of woman, in connection with
her growing economic independence, will prove harmful to
society through her refusal of matrimony or maternity appears
equally groundless. According to Dike, "the demand
for her enfranchisement, either as a right or on the ground
of expediency, grows out of this way of treating her as an
individual whose relations to society are less a matter of
condition and more of personal choice. And this principle
is carried into a sphere entirely her own. A partial loss of
capacity for maternity has, it is said, already befallen American
women; and the voluntary refusal of its responsibilities
is the lament of the physician and the moralist."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> It is true
that the birth-rate is falling.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> So far as this depends upon
male sensuality, a prevalent cause of sterility; upon selfish
love of ease and luxury&mdash;of which men even more than
women are guilty; or upon the disastrous influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
present extremes of wealth and poverty&mdash;of which women
as well as men are the victims&mdash;it is a serious evil which
may well cause us anxiety; but so far as it is the result of the
desire for fewer but better-born children&mdash;for which, let us
hope, the advancing culture of woman may in part be responsible&mdash;it
is in fact a positive social good.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> It is true also that,
while fewer and fewer marriages in proportion to the population
are taking place, men as well as women are marrying
later and later in life.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Here again, for the reasons just
mentioned, the results are both good and bad. Certain it is
that early marriages and excessive child-bearing have been the
twin causes of much injury to the human race. "To the superficial
observer," declares a writer very conservative as to the
effects of woman's emancipation, "it may appear that every
marriage must enrich the state, and that early marriages
must lessen the amount of sexual immorality, but inquiry
will prove conclusively how fallacious are those views. Early
marriages certainly tend to the production of large families,
but then a family, to be a source of wealth to the state, must
at least be self-supporting, which is exactly what the feeble,
degenerate children of the great mass of our early marriages
are not. They are brought forth ill-developed and unhealthy;
their immature, improvident parents are unable to
either feed or educate them as they ought to be fed and
educated; hence, instead of being a source of wealth to the
state, they prove a serious drain upon her resources. A large
percentage of these miserable children succumb during
infancy, but a great number drag out a pitiful existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
only to become inmates of our workhouses and infirmaries,
our asylums and prisons, and, after being supported at the
public expense for a longer or shorter period, to die prematurely,
leaving the state poorer than they found it and no
better. It is indeed a small percentage of the children of
the immature that ever become robust useful, self-supporting
citizens."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>It is not marriage or maternity which educated women
are shunning; but they are declining to view marriage as
their sole vocation or to become merely child-bearing animals.
Let us not worry about the destiny of college women.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> It
is simply wrong wedlock which they are avoiding. They
have, suggests Muirhead, a careful regard for the "kind" of
marriage. They are determined to have only "the genuine
article." They "look in marriage not only for the old
fashioned 'union of hearts,' but for the union of heart and
head in some serious interest which will survive the mere
attractions of sex and form a solid bond of union even in the
absence of others which, like the birth of children, depend
on fortune." So "far from being hostile" to the family,
"they are only preparing the way for a purer and more beneficent
form of family life." The "maternal instinct is
happily not confined to the uneducated."<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> The rise of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
more refined sentiment of love has become at once a check
and an incentive to marriage.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
Long ago Mrs. John Stuart Mill explained how essential
are knowledge and equality to render woman the real companion
of man in the struggle for existence; how the subjection
and ignorance of the wife degrade not only her own
character, but that of the husband as well. "There is hardly
any situation more unfavorable to the maintenance of elevation
of character, or force of intellect, than to live in the
society, and seek by preference the sympathy, of inferiors
in mental endowments."<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>If woman's even partnership with man in the nurture of the
family and in facing the exigencies of external life depends
mainly on equal education, never was such education more
urgently required than at the present hour. Social and
industrial problems are constantly demanding higher and
higher mental training for their solution. The same is true
of the problem of the family. It is very largely a question
of reform and development in home education. Clearly,
then, husband and wife have great need of intelligent sympathy
and counsel in the discharge of their joint, yet partially
differentiated, tasks. Hence, it should be the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
function of public education to promote this healthy companionship
in social duty. Furthermore, American experience
appears to show that it can best do so by training
young men and women together. Indeed, in this regard
the sociological value of coeducation is very important.
Theoretically it seems reasonable to assume that those who
are to work together in later life may gain some advantage
by spending the years of study side by side. The practical
result of coeducation in the western states, where it has been
given the freest opportunity, appears to demonstrate that
such is actually the case. The majority of those who have
had extended experience, after making all due allowance for
special difficulties to be surmounted, are emphatic in their
opinion that mentally and morally both sexes are the gainers
by it, as compared with training in separate institutions.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
It is true that eventually marriages very often result from
such associations. That is precisely the gist of the matter.
Are not the conditions entirely favorable to the fostering
of happy unions? Under what better auspices can attachments
be formed than when young men and women are learning
to gauge each other's character through the varied
social and intellectual rivalries of the years of scholastic
life?</p>

<p>Educational equality, however, is but one aspect of the
movement for woman's liberation. There are other factors
of the ideal partnership of the sexes in the uplifting of
society. Intellectual emancipation is proceeding, and necessarily
must proceed, hand in hand with political and economic
emancipation. The three movements are in large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
measure blended and interdependent. The participation of
woman in the new vocations&mdash;industrial, artistic, professional,
or administrative&mdash;implies a great advance in mental
training. It means a distinct unfoldment of faculties and
character. "No sociological change equal in importance to
this clearly marked improvement of an entire sex has ever
taken place in one century."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> It is a revolution in which
one-half of the human race is becoming an equal factor with
the other in intellectual and economic production. At last
woman is gaining a share in the social consciousness; she is
entering into the social organization as a new and regenerative
force. Doubtless, in the process of readjusting new
functions and conditions to the old some temporary harm
may ensue. Yet happily the alarm is subsiding lest by her
entrance on the new vocations woman should permanently
wreck her physical constitution, refuse to marry, or cause
industrial disaster through over-competition.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> With far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
greater justice a century ago it was complained that the
"intrusion of men-traders" into woman's work was driving
her to destitution and thus fostering the "social evil."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> The
callings into which women are charged with "intruding"
were, many of them, women's callings before they were men's.</p>

<p>It is within the family itself that the growing economic
independence of woman is producing the highest sociological
results. Under the old domestic régime on both sides of
the sea the woman who married entered legally, potentially,
upon a life of financial bondage. In the theory of the common
law the wife, with her children, her goods, and the
fruits of her toil, was the sole property of the husband.
Only in 1886 did the mother in England gain legal capacity
for the partial custody of her offspring;<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> and in but few of
the American states has she been placed on equal footing
with the father in this regard.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Even now the "husband
in England can claim damage from the man who has ruined
his family life, but the woman can claim none from the rival
who has supplanted her."<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> In both England and the United
States notable progress has already been made in equalizing
the property rights of the sexes; but the process is yet far
from complete. The prevailing conception of marriage as a
status in which the wife is "supported" by the husband is
degrading in its influence on the woman's character. It
tends to deaden her moral perceptions and to paralyze her
mental powers. Girls are trained, or they are forced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
poverty, to look upon wedlock as an economic vocation, as a
means of getting a living. The result is that under the old
order marriage tends to become a species of purchase-contract
in which the woman barters her sex-capital to the
man in exchange for a life-support. The man&mdash;not the
woman as originally&mdash;has become the chooser in sex-selection.
In the family, therefore, the sex-motive has become
excessively pronounced, thrusting into the background higher
social and spiritual ideals.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> The liberation movement thus
means in a high degree the socialization of one-half of the
human race. Woman declines longer to be restricted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dwarfing environment of sexual seclusion; and demands
the means and the privilege of engaging in the larger activities
of self-conscious society.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>We are thus confronted by still another phase of the
emancipation movement&mdash;the divorce problem. In this
problem woman has a peculiar interest. The wife more frequently
than the husband is seeking in divorce a release
from marital ills; for in her case it often involves an escape
from sexual slavery. The divorce movement, therefore, is
in part an expression of woman's growing independence. In
this instance as in others it does not, of course, follow that
the individualistic tendency is vicious. Nowhere in the
field of social ethics, perhaps, is there more confusion of
thought than in dealing with the divorce question. Divorce
is not favored by anyone for its own sake. Probably in
every healthy society the ideal of right marriage is a lifelong
union. But what if it is not right, if the marriage is
a failure? Is there no relief? Here a sharp difference of
opinion has arisen. Some persons look upon divorce as an
evil in itself; others as a "remedy" for, or a "symptom" of,
social disease. The one class regard it as a cause; the other
as an effect. To the Roman Catholic, and to those who
believe with him, divorce is a sin, the sanction of "successive
polygamy,"<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> of "polygamy on the instalment plan."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
At the other extreme are those who, like Milton and Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
would allow marriage to be dissolved freely by mutual
consent, or even at the desire of either spouse. Nay, there
are earnest souls, shocked by the intolerable hardships which
wives may suffer under the marital yoke, who, pending a
reform in the marriage law, would, like the Quakers of
earlier days, ignore the present statutory requirements and
resort to private contract.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> According to the prevailing
opinion, however, as expressed in modern legislation, divorce
should be allowed, with more or less freedom, under careful
state regulation. Whatever degree of liberty may be just
or expedient in a more advanced state of moral development,
it is felt that now a reasonable conservatism is the safer
course. Yet divorce is sanctioned by the state as an individual
right; and there may be occasions when the exercise
of the right becomes a social duty. The right is, of course,
capable of serious abuse. Loose divorce laws may even
invite crime. Nevertheless, it is fallacious to represent the
institution of divorce as in itself a menace to social morality.
It is not helpful to allege, as is often done, that with the
increase of divorce certain crimes wax more frequent, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
insinuating the effect for the cause. It is just as illogical
to assume that the prevalence of divorce in the United
States is a proof of moral decadence as compared with other
countries in which divorce is prohibited or more restricted.
To forbid the use of a remedy does not prove that there is
no disease. Is there any good reason for believing that
what Tocqueville said fifty years ago is not true today?
"Assuredly," he declares, "America is the country in the
world where the marriage tie is most respected and where
the highest and justest idea of conjugal happiness has been
conceived."<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> It is remarkable, says Lecky, "that this great
facility of divorce should exist in a country which has long
been conspicuous for its high standard of sexual morality
and for its deep sense of the sanctity of marriage."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Bryce
passes a similar judgment: "So far as my own information
goes, the practical level of sexual morality is at least as high
in the United States as in any part of northern or western
Europe (except possibly among the Roman Catholic peasantry
of Ireland)." There "seems no ground for concluding
that the increase of divorce in America necessarily
points to a decline in the standard of domestic morality,
except perhaps in a small section of the wealthy class,
though it must be admitted that if this increase should
continue, it may tend to induce such a decline."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Even
more emphatic is Commissioner Wright. After eloquently
describing the relatively high place which woman has
reached in our land, he continues: "I do not believe that
divorce is a menace to the purity and sacredness of the
family; but I do believe that it is a menace to the infernal
brutality, of whatever name, and be it crude or refined, which
at times makes a hell of the holiest human relations. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
believe the divorce movement finds its impetus outside of
laws, outside of our institutions, outside of our theology;
that it finds its impetus in the rebellion of the human heart
against that slavery which binds in the cruelest bonds of the
cruelest prostitution human beings who have, by their foolishness,
by their want of wisdom, or by the intervention of
friends, missed the divine purpose, as well as the civil purpose
of marriage. I believe the result will be an enhanced
purity, a sublimer sacredness, a more beautiful embodiment
of Lamartine's trinity,&mdash;the trinity of the father, the
mother, and the child"&mdash;to preserve which "in all its
sacredness, society must take the bitter medicine labelled
'Divorce.'"<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>This brings us to the root of the matter: the need of a
loftier popular ideal of the marriage relation. "An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure." While bad legislation
and a low standard of social ethics continue to throw recklessly
wide the door which opens to wedlock, there must of necessity
be a broad way out. How ignorantly, with what utter
levity,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> are marriages often contracted; how many thousands
of parents fail to give their children any serious warning
against yielding to transient impulse in choosing a mate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
how few have received any real training with respect to the
duties and responsibilities of conjugal life! What proper
check is society placing upon the marriage of the unfit? Is
there any boy or girl so immature if only the legal age of
consent has been reached; is there any "delinquent" so
dangerous through inherited tendencies to disease or crime;
is there any worn out debauchee, who cannot somewhere find
a magistrate or a priest to tie the "sacred" knot? It is a
very low moral sentiment which tolerates modern wife-purchase
or husband-purchase for bread, title, or social
position. "As our laws stare us in the face," exclaims an
eloquent writer, "there is no man so drunken, so immoral,
so brutal, so cruel, that he may not take to himself the
purest, the most refined, the most sensitive of women to wife,
if he can get her. There is no woman so paltry, so petty, so
vain, so inane, so enfeebled in body and mind by corsets or
chloral, flirtation, or worse, that she may not become the
wife of an intellectual, honorable man, and the mother of his
doomed children. There is no pauper who may not wed a
pauper and beget paupers to the end of his story. There is
no felon returned from his prison, or loose upon society uncondemned,
who may not make a base play at wedlock, and
perpetuate his diseased soul and body in those of his descendants,
without restraint. There is no member of what
we call our 'respectable' classes who may not, if he choose,
make a mock of the awful name of marriage, in sacrilege to
which we are so used that we scarcely lift an eyelid to
suppress surprise or aversion at the sickening variety of the
offence."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>It is vain to conceal from ourselves the fact that here is a
real menace to society. Marriages thus formed are almost
sure to be miserable failures from the start. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
simple truth, as earnest writers have insisted, that often
under such conditions the nuptial ceremony is but a legal
sanction of "prostitution within the marriage bond," whose
fruit is wrecked motherhood and the feeble, base-born children
of unbridled lust. The command to "be fruitful and
multiply," under the selfish and thoughtless interpretation
which has been given it, has become a heavy curse to
womanhood and a peril to the human race.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> On the face of
it, is it not grotesque to call such unions holy or to demand
that they shall be indissoluble? What chance is there under
such circumstances for a happy family life or for worthy
home-building? In sanctioning divorce the welfare of the
children may well cause the state anxiety; but are there not
thousands of so-called "homes" from whose corrupting and
blighting shadow the sooner a child escapes the better for
both it and society?</p>

<p>How shall the needed reform be accomplished? The
raising of ideals is a slow process. It will not come through
the statute-maker, though he can do something to provide a
legal environment favorable for the change. It must come
through an earnest and persistent educational effort which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
shall fundamentally grapple with the whole group of problems
which concern the related, though distinct, institutions
of marriage, the home, and the family. In this work every
grade in the educational structure, from the university to
the kindergarten and the home circle, must have its appropriate
share. Already a few of our higher institutions have
made a worthy beginning. Departments of physical culture,
economics, history, and sociology are providing instruction
of real value. But the movement should become universal;
and the curriculum should be broadened and deepened. The
actual concrete problems must be dealt with frankly and
without flinching. To gain the right perspective it is highly
important that a thorough historical basis should be laid
through the study of ethnology, comparative religion, and
the evolution of cultural, economic, and matrimonial institutions.
Moreover, the elements of such a training in domestic
sociology should find a place in the public school program.
If need be, a little more arithmetic or a little more Latin
may be sacrificed. Where now, except perhaps in an indirect
or perfunctory way, does the school boy or girl get
any practical suggestion as to home-building, the right social
relations of parent and child, much less regarding marriage
and the fundamental questions of the sexual life? In this
field the home, as the complement or coadjutor of the school
and the state, has a precious opportunity. Indeed, our inspiring
hope lies in the fact that, in spite of unfavorable
conditions, many homes, presided over by enlightened
parents, are discharging worthily, if not yet ideally, the high
function of social training. Here father, mother, and child
are equal members of the "trinity." Here it is held as
binding an obligation and as joyous a privilege for the
parents to honor their children as for the children to honor
their parents. Of a truth, is there anything on earth more
beautiful and inspiring than the real companionship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
parent and child; than a home life in which the characters
of the young are molded and their faculties drawn out by
free and frank discussion with their elders; where mutual
love is based on mutual respect? But what shall be said of
the opposite picture&mdash;of the countless families in which
mother and child still cower before the paternal despot;
where authority and not reason prevails; where, as in the
good old colonial days, the child is harshly thrust into the
background and his insistent individualism is insulted and
repressed? Before the home can become a healthful school
for social education, parents must themselves be trained;
they must become aware of their real place in the social
order.</p>

<p>In the future educational program sex questions must
hold an honorable place. Progress in this direction may be
slow, because of the false shame, the prurient delicacy, now
widely prevalent touching everything connected with the
sexual life. Nor is it a light matter to brave orthodox sentiment
in this regard. It is not always safe for the teacher,
even in institutions deeming themselves modern, to deal
frankly with the organic facts which are of vital concern to
the human race. The folly of parents in leaving their children
in ignorance of the laws of sex is notorious. Yet how
much safer than ignorance is knowledge as a shield for innocence.
The daughter will face the vicissitudes of life more
securely if she has been told of the destiny that awaits her
as wife and mother; if she has been warned of the snares
with which lust has beset the path of womanhood. The son
is likely to live a nobler life if he has learned to repudiate
the dual standard of sexual morality which a spurious philosophy
has set up; if he understands that "instincts" may
be safely controlled; if he has been warned that selfish
excesses within or without the marriage bond must be dearly
paid for by the coming generations. Indeed, it is of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
greatest moment to society that the young should be trained
in the general laws of heredity. Everywhere men and
women are marrying in utter contempt of the warnings of
science. Domestic animals are literally better bred than
human beings. Through ignorance and defiance of the
rules of health, we are destroying our physical constitutions.
Under the plea of "romantic love" we blindly yield to sexual
attractions in choosing our mates, selfishly ignoring the
welfare of the race. Is there not a higher ideal of conjugal
choice? Experience shows that in wedlock natural and
sexual selection should play a smaller and artificial selection
a larger rôle.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> The safety of the social body requires that a
check be put upon the propagation of the unfit. Here the
state has a function to perform. In the future much more
than now, let us hope, the marriage of persons mentally delinquent
or tainted by hereditary disease or crime will be
legally restrained. Yet law can do relatively little. A
reform of this kind must of necessity depend mainly upon
a better educated popular sentiment; upon a higher altruism
which shall be capable of present sacrifice for the permanent
good of the race. "When human beings and families rationally
subordinate their own interests as perfectly to the welfare
of future generations as do animals under the control of
instinct the world will have a more enduring type of family
life than exists at present. This can only be accomplished
by the development of controlling ideals which are supported
not only by reason and intelligence but by ethical impulse
and religious motive. This larger altruism which protects
the permanent interests of the future against the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
temporary values of the present must be of the heart as
much as of the head.... In the mating of men and
women, money, social position, worldly expediency, the conventional
and fictitious values so influential in these days,
will count for much less, while organic health and efficiency,
character, unselfish devotion to high ideals, to the great
world interests will count for far more. In this obedience
to ideals so farsighted, romantic love will not be lost in any
way, as some seem to fear. Men and women will not choose
one another in cold blood simply because intelligence and
reason point the way, but human sentiment and every romantic
quality will be enhanced when permanent and future
interests are furthered by a saner and finer human choice."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>There is then no need to despair of the future. It is
vain to turn back the hand on the dial. The problem of individual
liberty has become the problem of social liberty.
Individualization for the sake of socialization must continue
its beneficent work. There must be growth, constant readjustment.
Marriage will in truth be holy if it rests on
the free trothplight of equals whose love is deep enough to
embrace a rational regard for the rights of posterity. The
home will not have less sanctity when through it flows the
stream of the larger human life. The family will, indeed,
survive; but it will be a family of a higher type. Its evolution
is not yet complete. Coercive ties will still further
yield to voluntary spiritual ties; for individual liberty
appears to be the essential condition of social progress.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INDEX</h2>


<p>Apparently no successful attempt has ever been made to prepare
a complete and systematic bibliography of matrimonial institutions.
Indeed, to do so would be a formidable undertaking; but
that such a book would be of vast service to social history no one
can doubt. Useful lists of authorities, however, are appended to
the works of various writers, notably to Lubbock's <i>Origin of Civilization</i>;
Starcke's <i>Primitive Family</i>; Chamberlain's <i>Child and
Childhood</i>; Lehr's <i>Le mariage</i>; and especially Westermarck's
<i>Human Marriage</i>. For marriage with kindred, including the
deceased wife's sister, there is a good, though not exhaustive, bibliography
by A. H. Huth in the <i>Report of the First Annual Meeting
of the Index Society</i> (London, 1879), 25-47; greatly enlarged
in his <i>Marriage of Near Kin</i> (2d ed., London, 1887), 394-465.
Ethbin Heinrich Costa's <i>Bibliographie der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte</i>
(Braunschweig, 1858) is helpful, particularly for the earlier
monographic literature. For supplementary materials, especially
the curiosities of the subject, consult Hugo Hayn's <i>Bibliotheca
Germanorum erotica: Verzeichniss der gesammten deutschen
erotischen Literatur mit Einschluss der Uebersetzungen, nebst
Angabe der fremden Originale</i> (2d ed., Leipzig, 1885); the same
writer's <i>Bibliotheca Germanorum nuptialis</i> (Cologne, 1890); and
the well-known <i>Bibliographie des ouvrages relatifs à l'amour, aux
femmes, au mariage</i>, etc. (3d ed., 6 vols., San Remo, London, Nice,
and Turin, 1871-73). Legal works on marriage and related institutions
are included in Martin Lipenius's <i>Bibliotheca realis juridica
omnium materiarum, rerum, et titulorum, in universo
universi juris ambitu occurrentium, post F. G. Struvii et G. A.
Jenichenii curas emendata ... et locupletata</i> (2 vols., folio, Leipzig,
1757); but of much more service for the present purpose is the
great work of J. F. von Schulte, <i>Die Geschichte der Quellen und
Literatur des canonischen Rechts von Gratian bis auf die Gegenwart</i>
(3 vols., bound in 4, Stuttgart, 1875-80). Many recent publications
are entered in George K. Fortescue's <i>Subject Index of the
Modern Works Added to the Library of the British Museum in
the Years 1880-1895</i> (3 vols., London, 1886-97); while Poole's <i>Index</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
contains the titles of more than 1,200 articles on various phases of
the subject, including woman in her family relations.</p>

II, 214, who says: "Not unfrequently the judicial declaration of nullity is called a
'divorce.' It is properly so when the marriage it declares void was only voidable.
For example, it is common and correct in law language to speak of impotence as
cause for divorce;" but to prevent confusion he favors the term "sentence" or "decree
of nullity" to indicate "the legal avoiding of a voidable marriage." On the
other hand, <span class="smcap">Shelford</span>, <i>Marriage and Divorce</i>, 365, holds that "divorce" cannot properly
be applied to sentences for annulment of either void or voidable marriages.
For the present state of the law this appears to be the right conclusion. <span class="smcap">Blackstone</span>,

act of 1785 provides that the penalties for "polygamy," which it prescribes, shall not
extend "to any person that is or shall be at the time of such marriage divorced, by
sentence of any Court ... unless such person is the guilty cause of such divorce."&mdash;<i>Acts
and Laws</i> (Reprint, Boston, 1784), 118; also in <i>Perpetual Laws of the Com.
of Mass.</i>, I, 217, 218. The act of 1786, chap. 69, provides that all "marriages where
either of the parties shall have a former wife or husband living at the time of
such marriage, shall be absolutely void."&mdash;<i>Perpetual Laws of the Com.</i>, I, 301. This
provision is ambiguous, and might of itself seem to make void the marriage even of
the innocent party to a divorce; but, in the case just cited, the court held: "Supposing
the legislature to have considered the parties to a marriage which had been
dissolved as standing in the relation of husband and wife, so far as to bring them
within the purview of the former statute [that of 1785], it will follow that a marriage
of persons so situated would be void. It is true, that by this statute [that of 1786]
standing by itself, the marriage of an innocent party to a divorce would not be protected;
but the statutes, being <i>in pari materia</i>, must be construed together, and the
exception in the first cited statute in favor of such persons, would avail."&mdash;1

very general. For instance, the court may assign the woman as alimony any part of
her late husband's estate not exceeding one-third thereof. If divorced for her misconduct,
all property received from the husband in consideration of the marriage or
of "love and affection" must be restored. A minor child must be supported by the
parents; and upon complaint of either of them at any time, the court may inquire
into their pecuniary ability, and pass a decree against either or both for its just
maintenance: <i>Gen. Stat. of Conn.</i> (1888), 612-14. See also <i>Gen. Laws of R. I.</i> (1896),
633-36; <i>Rev. Stat. of Maine</i> (1884), 520-23, where it is provided that, when a divorce is
decreed for the adultery of the wife, the husband "may hold her personal estate forever,
and her real estate, of which she was seized during coverture, during his life, if
they had a child born alive during marriage, otherwise during her life only, if he
survives her; but the court may allow her so much of her real or personal estate as
is necessary for her subsistence."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, 522. But by an act of 1903 it is provided that
where the wife is at fault the husband is "entitled to one-third, in common and
undivided of all her real estate, except wild lands, which shall descend to him as if
she were dead;" and the court in its discretion may grant him a part of her personal
estate. In all cases the right, title, or interest of the libellee in the libellant's real
estate is barred by the decree of divorce: <i>Acts and Resolves</i> (1903), 171.</p></div>

The omission of the clause expressly requiring legislative sanction in the constitution
of 1832 seems clearly to be intended to abolish legislative divorce. Yet the act of 1840
makes the decrees of the courts "final and conclusive, as fully as though the same
had been confirmed by the legislature;" from which language one would naturally
infer that the legislature had continued to ratify divorces after the constitution
went into effect: <i>Laws</i> (1840), 51.

<p>
By an act of March 9, 1855 (<i>Pub. Laws</i>, 68; <span class="smcap">Pepper and Lewis</span>, <i>Digest</i>, I, 1636),
the courts of common pleas are given jurisdiction in all cases of divorce "from the
bonds of matrimony for the cause of personal abuse, or for such conduct on the part
of either the husband or the wife as to render the condition of the other party
intolerable and life burdensome, notwithstanding the parties were at the time of
the occurring of said causes domiciled in another state;" but the applicant must be
a citizen and have been a resident of the state for one year. This act, according to
judicial interpretation, does not establish new causes for divorce, but only enlarges
the jurisdiction of the court in reference to the parties under causes already recognized:

treatment must be alleged in the libel: Pennington <i>v.</i> Pennington, <i>ibid.</i>, 22.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_537_537" id="Footnote_537_537"></a><a href="#FNanchor_537_537"><span class="label">[537]</span></a> In Abbie Rose Wood <i>v.</i> Estate of Joseph M. Wood, filed in the superior court of
San Francisco, June 14, 1900, Judge Belcher decided that the marriage on Jan. 1,
1898, in Reno, Nev., of a person divorced in California, Aug. 19, 1897, the former husband
still living, was not valid. He relies upon the words of nullity in the amendment
of 1897; and the fact that the person went to another state solely for the purpose
of getting married while still retaining her domicile in California. "Section 61,
Civil Code, contains no penal clause, as stated; but it does contain words of nullity,
and words which suspend, as to third persons, the operation of the decree ... ;
and these cannot be avoided by merely invoking another jurisdiction for that purpose.
The two sections (61 and 91, C. C.) are to be read together, and, so read, their
interpretation and meaning are free from either uncertainty or ambiguity. The law
of the domicile is invoked, and the law of the domicile controls. No other jurisdiction
can relieve against it."&mdash;See <i>San Fran. Law Journal</i> (July 2, 1900), 1.
</p>
<p>
In a case decided on Dec. 10, 1900, Judge Trout, of the superior court of San
Francisco, takes the same position as Judge Belcher.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, on Dec. 4, 1900, Judge Hebbard, of the same court, in Adler <i>v.</i>
Adler, maintains the validity of a similar Reno marriage. He holds that the California
law "is in restraint of marriage," since it fixes an arbitrary prohibitory
period. "We may imagine the reason which induced the passage of the section, by
an examination of the law of the State of Oregon upon the same subject. In that
state there is no fixed prohibitory period, but the law is to the effect that, pending
an appeal from a decree of divorce, if one be taken, and, if not, during the time in
which it may be taken, the parties shall be incapable of contracting marriage with
a third person. In California an appeal from a final judgment must be taken in six
months; an appeal from an order granting or refusing a new trial in sixty days. The
great majority of divorce cases go to judgment upon the default of the defendants,
and in such cases there can be no appeal upon the merits of the cause. When no
appeal can be taken, or when the time for appeal has gone by and none taken, why
compel the parties in the case to abstain from matrimony for the remainder of the
year thereafter? The proportion of divorce decrees appealed from is infinitely small,
and therefore the prohibition in section 61 discriminates against the many, for the
protection of the few; it is an arbitrary law." He relies upon Pearson <i>v.</i> Pearson,
51 <i>Cal.</i>, 120 (1875), construing sec. 63 of the Civil Code to the effect that "all marriages
contracted without this state, which would be valid by the laws of the country
in which the same were contracted, are valid in this state."&mdash;<i>San Fran. Law Journal</i>
(July 16, 1900), 1.</p></div>

A powerful influence on revolutionary opinion must have been exerted by the
remarkable <i>Contrat conjugal</i>, published in 1781, again in 1783, and in German translation
in 1784, which advocated civil marriage and free divorce, while attacking the
ecclesiastical system of impediments and dispensations. The revolutionary ideas
regarding divorce are also vigorously presented by <span class="smcap">Hennet</span>, <i>Du divorce</i> (3d ed.,
Paris, 1792); and by <span class="smcap">Bouchotte</span>, <i>Observations sur le divorce</i> (Paris, 1790). On the

Accordingly, in 1798, the law was amended so as to make divorce for "incompatibility
allowable only six months after final failure of attempts at reconciliation;" and this
law also required all municipal authorities to proceed, and all teachers of public and
private schools to take their pupils, "to the usual meeting places of the community
every ten years in person and in state, there to make stern proclamation of the
parties divorced during the previous decade, with the view of thus checking

case. In 1785 John Guest "left the state for foreign parts." During his absence, in
1792, his wife Elizabeth married Reed. Subsequently in the same year her first husband,
Guest, returned to the state and there resided until his death in June, 1800.
He professed to have no marital claim upon Elizabeth; so she lived with Reed as a
wife continuously from 1792 until the latter's death in 1806. Was she the lawful wife
of Reed from 1792 to 1800 during the lifetime of Guest? If not, was she, without the
observance of any formalities, his lawful wife from 1800 to 1806 after Guest's demise?
To the first question the court answered "no," holding that "the statute concerning
bigamy does not render the second marriage legal, notwithstanding the former husband
or wife may have been absent above five years, and not heard of. It only
declares that the party who marries again in consequence of such absence ... ,
shall be exempted from the operation of the statute, and leaves the question of the
validity of the second marriage just where it found it." To the second question the

1 <span class="smcap">Gray</span>, 119. "Some years ago a young girl, only thirteen years of age, named Sarah
Hervey, was enticed away from her widowed mother's house by a young fellow,
named Parton, of bad character and dissolute habits, who by false representations
as to the age of the girl, procured a marriage license, and persuaded a magistrate to
formally marry them. She returned to the house of her mother who forbade the
young man to see her. Upon his petition against the mother for writ of habeas
corpus, the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth, after full consideration, ordered
the young wife to be surrendered to the husband, and he bore her away in triumph....
The mother then brought suit against a confederate of the husband, who had
aided in enticing away the girl and in practising the fraud upon the magistrate; but
the mother again failed in her efforts to vindicate her rights to protect her daughter,
since it distinctly appeared that the marriage was with the daughter's full and free
consent."&mdash;Hervey <i>v.</i> Moseley (1856), 7 <span class="smcap">Gray</span>, 449; as summarized by <span class="smcap">Bennett</span>, "Uniformity

was) at Aberdeen, O.: <span class="smcap">Whitney</span>, <i>Marriage and Divorce</i>, 43; another at Greenwich,
Conn. Oct. 2, 1900, the San Francisco <i>Chronicle</i> had the following telegram: "Greenwich's
reputation as a Gretna Green and that of Judge Burns of Greenwich of the
Borough court as one who marries all who come, appears to have extended to the
Pacific Slope. On Saturday there arrived in town &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; of Alameda, California,
and &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; of Los Angeles, California. They went to Judge Burns' office, arranged
for the marriage ceremony, and then secured a marriage license from the town clerk....
Immediately after the ceremony" they "left town, maintaining the greatest
secrecy as is the usual custom." Another wedding resort, for the benefit of Chicago,
is the little town of St. Joseph, Mich., where in the four years, 1897-1900, 1,594 licenses
are said to have been issued to persons residing outside the state, the ceremony being
performed by ministers. In 1903 an attempt to adopt the Wisconsin plan, requiring
an interval of five days between the issue of the license and the celebration, failed
by a very few votes.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
"Another charge made against our divorce laws is that, not being uniform, certain
states are being overrun with persons of loose moral character, who seek release
from marriage ties. Those who make this charge seem to overlook the fact that
persons of loose moral character would not be liable to go to the trouble of leaving
their home and state in order to gratify guilty passions. But those who find the
marriage tie too galling for endurance and yet who wish to be law-abiding citizens
presumably, will take advantage of liberal, enlightened, and humane laws, framed
with a view to increase the happiness of the people rather than made in such a way
as to foster immorality and enforced prostitution."</p></div>

1873 reduced the time of desertion necessary to constitute a ground of divorce from
five to three years. Divorces increased from 337 in 1872 to 611 in 1874. A part of this
gain was probably due to the change in law, although in all the entire group of
north Atlantic states there was at the same time a large increase which cannot be
thus accounted for. The lax law of residence in Utah previous to 1878, and the reduction
of the term of desertion from two years to one by the Dakota legislature in
1881, were each responsible for an increase in the divorce rate: compare <span class="smcap">Wright</span>,

Berlin statistics for 1878 which show that divorced men remarry within the first three
years at about the same rate as widowers, while divorced women remarry more
rapidly than widows. The results obtained from Swiss statistics are nearly the
same: see the table in <span class="smcap">Bertillon</span>, "Du sort des divorcés," <i>Jour. de la société de statistique

the other hand, <span class="smcap">Oettingen</span>, <i>Die Moralstatistik</i>, 153-62, on the basis of statistics for
Saxony (1834-49) and the Netherlands (1850-54), shows a strong tendency to remarry
on the part of divorced persons of either sex, as compared with widows and widowers,
the divorced women remarrying much more frequently than the men. <span class="smcap">Dike</span>,
<i>Rep. of the Nat. Div. Ref. League</i> (1891), 18, gives some facts for Connecticut. In
1889, 286 divorced persons were married, "135 men and 151 women, which is a little
above one-third of the number divorced in the year. In 1890 there were 477 divorces
granted, or 954 individuals divorced: and there were 350 divorced persons"&mdash;143 men
and 207 women&mdash;"who married again." To be of much value these figures should
be compared with the number of marriages of widowers and widows for the same
period.</p></div>

But the statistics seem to show that the law is conservatively administered. The
number of divorces is decreasing. "For the years 1891-95, inclusive, the annual
average was 7,258. In 1896 there were 8,601; in 1897 there were 9,005; in 1898 there
were 9,143; and in 1899 they had become 9,563. But under the new law in 1900 they

</p>
<p>
The other grounds of divorce allowed by the imperial statute are adultery,
attempt on the life of either spouse by the other, malicious desertion, and insanity
(Geisteskrankheit) of three years' standing. Divorce for malicious desertion is
decreed only after a preliminary suit for the re-establishment of marital relations
and a year's delay to allow the deserter to return to conjugal duty: <i>Reichsgesetzbuch</i>,

and intolerance sanctioned by the Hardwicke act of 1753, at that time in force.
In 1840 he declared, as regards the <i>form</i> of marriage, that the law of 1836 had "exactly"
met his "ideas and wishes;" and that all which he then desired was "to see
another law enacted, by which <i>Divorces</i>, under wise arrangements, and on principles

<i>Lettres d'un bourgeois de New Haven à un citoyen de Virginie</i> (1787) compressed into
a few sentences the basic arguments for the movement. In the same year appeared
<span class="smcap">Mary Wollstonecraft's</span> <i>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</i>, a forerunner of
her <i>Vindication</i> five years later. During the next fifty years a few earnest champions
of woman's freedom came forward. First was <span class="smcap">Mary Anne Radcliffe</span>,

(London, 1799); followed by <span class="smcap">Hannah Mather Crocker</span>, <i>Observations on the Real

<i>Woman's Rights and Duties</i> (London, 1840). The movement took organic form in
1848, when the first convention was held at Seneca Falls, New York. This was
followed in 1850 by conventions in Ohio and Massachusetts. In 1851 <span class="smcap">Mrs. John

<p><a name="Footnote_831_831" id="Footnote_831_831"></a><a href="#FNanchor_831_831"><span class="label">[831]</span></a> This fact is seized upon in one of the most powerful books produced in recent
sociological discussion. According to Mrs. Stetson "we are the only animal species
in which the female depends on the male for food, the only animal species in which
the sex-relation is also an economic relation. With us an entire sex lives in a relation
of economic dependence upon the other sex." The wife may toil unceasingly;
but the labor which she "performs in the household is given as a part of her
functional duty, not as employment." She is therefore not her husband's "business
partner;" for as an intended equivalent for what she gets she contributes neither
labor nor capital nor experience nor even motherhood. She contributes her sex-attractions.
Sex-distinctions are therefore excessively developed; and the "sexuo-economic
relation" becomes inevitable. "By the economic dependence of the human
female upon the male, the balance of forces is altered. Natural selection no longer
checks the action of sexual selection, but coöperates with it;" for "man, in supporting
woman, has become her economic environment." Under "sexual selection the
human creature is of course modified to its mate, as with all creatures. When the
mate becomes also the master, when economic necessity is added to sex-attraction,
we have the two great evolutionary forces acting together to the same end; namely,
to develop sex-distinction in the human female. For, in her position of economic
dependence in the sexual relation, sex-distinction is with her not only a means of
attracting a mate, as with all creatures, but a means of getting a livelihood, as is
the case with no other creature under heaven. Because of the economic dependence
of the human female on her mate she is modified to sex to an excessive degree. This
excessive modification she transmits to her children; and so is steadily implanted in
the human constitution the morbid tendency to excess in this relation, which has
acted so universally upon us in all ages, in spite of our best efforts to restrain it."
While in man the immediate dominating force of sexual passion may be more conspicuous,
in woman it holds more universal sway. "For the man has other powers
and faculties in full use, whereby to break loose from the force of this; and the
woman, specially modified to sex and denied racial activity, pours her whole life
into love." Useful to the race as was this evolution originally, its influence for good
has long since reached its limit. Excessive sex-energy has threatened to "destroy
both individual and race." Hence woman is declining longer to be confined to her
highly specialized sexual function and is demanding an equal place in the social
organization. She is gaining a social consciousness: <span class="smcap">Stetson</span>, <i>Women and Economics</i>,

as property, then the declaration may, with advantage, seek the sanction of the
law." She mentions the well-known cases of Mary Wollstonecraft, her daughter
and Shelley, Richard Carlile, and that of George Henry Lewes and George Eliot.
Mrs. Caird would not go so far. The state, she concludes, hes no right to interfere
in the marriage contract. "How can it withdraw its interference without causing
social confusion? The answer seems plain. By a gradual widening of the limitations
within which individuals might be allowed to draw up their private contracts,
until, finally, moral standards had risen sufficiently high to enable the state to cease
from interfering in private concerns altogether."&mdash;<i>The Morality of Marriage</i>, 126.

Michigan illustrates the shocking frivolity with which the most important of
human relations is sometimes treated: "It is estimated that fully 20,000 people will
visit this city tomorrow to attend the third annual Maccabees' county picnic....
It is thought tomorrow will prove to be the greatest day in the history of St. Joseph
as the Gretna Green of Chicago.... Fully forty-four bridal couples will arrive
from Chicago to take advantage of being married free, as is offered by the Maccabees
in a part of their program. The parties with matrimonial intentions, upon calling
at Marriage Temple, will be furnished by County Clerk Needham with their license
and a handsome marriage certificate, free of charge, provided they consent to be
married in public from the verandah of the hotels. Any clergyman in the city, upon
request ... , will officiate. Hundreds of excursionists from Indiana will come for
the express purpose of witnessing the ceremonies." On this point read the interesting
